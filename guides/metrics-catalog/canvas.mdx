---

The **Canvas View** is a flexible workspace for visualizing and organizing metrics. You can use it to build **Metric Trees** that show how metrics relate to each other, visualize hierarchies, and understand dependencies across your data model.

### How to use the Canvas view

1. **Filter your metrics**: Use the search bar, categories, or table filters to narrow down the list. Canvas view works best with fewer than 30 metrics for smooth performance. Need help creating categories? [Learn more here](/guides/metrics-catalog/catalog#browsing-the-catalog).
2. **Enable Canvas view**: Switch to the Canvas view toggle in the metrics catalog.
3. **Add metrics**: Drag metrics from the sidebar into the canvas workspace.
4. **Create connections**: Drag between node handles to draw edges representing relationships and dependencies.
5. **Remove nodes**: Select a node and press **Backspace** to delete it.

<Note>
  Viewers can see trees and connections but cannot make edits.
</Note>

## Saved Trees

<Info>
  **Experimental:** Saved Trees is behind a feature flag. Reach out to support to enable it for your organization. Learn more about [Feature Maturity Levels](/references/workspace/feature-maturity-levels).
</Info>

Saved Trees are named, persistent canvas layouts that preserve your metric arrangements and connections. Unlike the ad-hoc canvas — where unconnected node positions reset between sessions — Saved Trees store the full layout including every node position and edge.

Saved Trees are shared across your team: anyone with access to the project can view them, and users with the right permissions can create, edit, and delete them.

### Creating a Saved Tree

  <img
    className="dark:hidden"
    src="/images/guides/metrics-catalog/canvas-saved-trees.png"
    alt="Saved Trees in Canvas view"
  />
</Frame>

1. In the Canvas View, click **New Tree** to enter edit mode.
2. Type a name in the text input at the top of the canvas.
3. Drag metrics from the sidebar into the canvas and draw connections between them.
4. Click **Save**. The button is disabled until you provide a name and add at least one node.

When you save, the tree name, node positions, edges, and metric references are all persisted.

Click **Cancel** to discard your work. If you have unsaved changes, a confirmation dialog will appear.

<Info>
  [Driver edges](#drivers) are not stored with the tree — they are injected automatically whenever matching nodes are present.
</Info>

### Collaborative locking

Only one user can edit a Saved Tree at a time. When you start editing, the tree is locked to you. The lock stays active while you work — if you stop editing for more than 2 minutes, the lock is automatically released so others can make changes.

When a tree is locked by another user, you'll see an **"Editing by "** badge in the header, and the Edit and Delete options are disabled until the lock is released.

Your changes are automatically saved as a draft while you edit, so if you accidentally close the tab or refresh the page, your work-in-progress can be recovered when you return.

## Drivers

Drivers are metrics that directly influence or feed into another metric. By defining drivers in your `.yml` files, you can automatically visualize how metrics relate to each other in the Canvas view — no manual drawing needed.

For example, `total_order_amount` is a driver of `total_revenue`, `average_order_size`, and `total_completed_order_amount` — because each of those metrics is influenced by the total order amount. On the canvas, this creates a tree where `total_order_amount` fans out to the metrics it drives.

### Defining drivers

Add a `drivers` property to any metric listing the metrics that flow into it. You can reference metrics from the same table or across tables using the `table.metric` syntax:

    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: order_amount
            meta:
              metrics:
                total_revenue:
                  type: sum
                  drivers:
                    - total_order_amount
                average_order_size:
                  type: average
                  drivers:
                    - total_order_amount
                total_completed_order_amount:

        columns:
          - name: order_amount
            config:
              meta:
                metrics:
                  total_revenue:

                  average_order_size:

                    drivers:
                      - total_order_amount
                  total_completed_order_amount:
                    type: sum
                    drivers:
                      - total_order_amount
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Lightdash YAML">
    ```yaml
    type: model
    name: orders
    
    dimensions:
      - name: order_amount
    
    metrics:
      total_revenue:
        type: sum
        sql: ${TABLE}.order_amount
        drivers:
          - total_order_amount
      average_order_size:
        type: average
        sql: ${TABLE}.order_amount
        drivers:
          - total_order_amount
      total_completed_order_amount:
        type: sum
        sql: ${TABLE}.order_amount
        drivers:
          - total_order_amount
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This creates edges on the canvas pointing from each driver to the current metric (e.g., `total_order_amount` → `total_revenue`, `total_order_amount` → `average_order_size`, etc.).

### How drivers appear on the canvas

- **Automatic**: Driver edges appear as soon as both the driver and target metrics are on the canvas.
- **Read-only**: You cannot delete or modify driver edges from the UI — they are managed through your `.yml` configuration.

In Saved Trees, driver edges are displayed alongside manually-created edges, giving you a complete picture of both the relationships you've drawn and the ones defined in your data model.

<Info>
  Driver edges cannot be removed from a Saved Tree. If you don't want a driver edge to appear, remove one of its endpoint nodes from the canvas.
