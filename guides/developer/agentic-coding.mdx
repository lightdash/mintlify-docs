AI coding agents can help you build and maintain your Lightdash semantic layer more efficiently. By installing Lightdash skills, you enable these agents to understand your semantic layer structure and use the latest Lightdash features correctly.

With Lightdash skills installed, you can build entire BI layers conversationally—from profiling your warehouse and creating metrics to building production dashboards—without opening the UI.

## What are skills?

Skills are context files that teach AI coding agents about Lightdash's YAML configuration, metrics, dimensions, and best practices. They're powered by [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) and provide agents with the knowledge they need to:

- Generate correct YAML configurations for metrics and dimensions
- Follow Lightdash naming conventions and best practices
- Understand table relationships and joins
- Use the latest Lightdash features and syntax

## What you can build

Once installed, AI agents with Lightdash skills can help you:

- **Build from scratch**: Create complete projects with no existing dbt files—just describe the report you want, and the agent will profile your warehouse, suggest metrics with descriptions and categories, and build dashboards with layouts, colors, tabs, and filters
- **Warehouse profiling**: Query your data warehouse to discover available tables and suggest relevant metrics for your use case
- **Bulk operations**: Make updates to 50+ charts in production, rename tables or metrics, and bulk update all dependent content
- **Migrations**: Move analysis from other tools to Lightdash by translating existing logic into Lightdash metrics
- **Best practices**: Review dashboards and charts for improvements, suggest better metric definitions, and refactor code
- **Rapid development**: Work conversationally to iterate on metrics, dimensions, and dashboards without context switching

<Tip>
Perfect for teams without an existing semantic layer. Just connect your warehouse, describe the report you want, and the agent works backwards to build the models.

## Supported tools

Lightdash skills work with popular AI coding assistants:

- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding assistant
- **Codex** - OpenAI's code generation model
- **Antigravity** - AI development platform
- Other tools that support the skills format

## Installing skills

Use the Lightdash CLI to install skills for your preferred AI coding agent.

### Prerequisites

- [Lightdash CLI installed](/guides/cli/how-to-install-the-lightdash-cli)

### Install for your project

Install skills at the project level (recommended for team collaboration):

```bash
# Install for Claude (default)
lightdash install-skills

# Install for Cursor
lightdash install-skills --agent cursor

# Install for Codex
lightdash install-skills --agent codex
```

This creates a skills directory at your git root:
- `.claude/skills/` for Claude
- `.cursor/skills/` for Cursor
- `.codex/skills/` for Codex

### Install globally

Install skills globally to use them across all your projects:

```bash
# Install globally for Claude
lightdash install-skills --global

# Install globally for Cursor
lightdash install-skills --agent cursor --global
```

Global skills are installed to your home directory (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/`).

### Install to a custom path

Specify a custom installation path:

```bash
lightdash install-skills --path ./my-project
```

## Using skills with your agent

Once installed, your AI coding agent automatically picks up the Lightdash skills. You can then ask your agent to:

- Create new metrics and dimensions
- Generate YAML configurations for dbt models
- Fix validation errors in your semantic layer
- Refactor existing metric definitions
- Add joins between tables

### Example prompts

**Build a dashboard from scratch:**
```
I want to build a customer retention dashboard. Profile my BigQuery warehouse
to find relevant tables, suggest key metrics like churn rate and retention
cohorts, and create a dashboard with tabs for monthly and quarterly views.
```

**Create metrics with metadata:**
```
Create revenue metrics for our orders table with descriptions and categories
for the metrics catalog. Include total revenue, average order value, and
revenue per customer.
```

**Bulk refactoring:**
```
Rename the "user" table to "customer" across all metrics, dimensions, and
dashboards. Update all references and maintain the relationships.
```

**Simple metric creation:**
```
Create a revenue metric that sums the amount field from the orders table
```

The agent uses the installed skills to generate correct, up-to-date Lightdash configurations. The Lightdash CLI provides everything the agent needs for verification, so you stay in control throughout the process.

## Keeping skills updated

Re-run the install command to get the latest skills:

```bash
lightdash install-skills
```

This downloads the newest skill definitions from the Lightdash repository, ensuring your agent knows about the latest features and best practices.
