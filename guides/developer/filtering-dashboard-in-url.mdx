In this guide you'll learn how to format a dashboard URL to apply dynamic values to saved filters on that dashbaord. You can even set up a dimension so when you click on it you are sent to a dashboard that gets filtered based on the dimension you clicked!

For example, you might have a sales dashbaord that shows your most profitable Partners, then use a URL so that when you click on a specific partner name it brings you to a new dashboard that is filtered to show KPIs filtered to that partner.

## Example of dashboard URL Filtering

Here's a quick walk through video that shows what it looks like once it's complete:

## Setting up dashboard URL filtering

This is the process for setting it up:

### Setup steps

1. Open the dashboard you want to dynamically filter.
2. Add a value to the filter you want to filter dynamically.
3. Copy the URL shown after applying the filter. It should look something like the image below.

<Info>
You'll notice there's a `?filters=` key in the URL. Everything after that is a JSON object that has been URL encoded. If you want to see the JSON you can find a URL decoder online to reformat it.

1. Replace the filter value that you chose in step 2 with `${ value.formatted | url_encode }` to make it dynamic. In the example the value is `Plant+Paradise` (highlighted in the image).
2. Paste that URL into the YAML file for the model you're working in. See an [example in our demo project here](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash-demo-data-gardening/blob/5632406cb5b43fdf066a2086142dc3e86a41e947/dbt/models/dbt%5Forders.yml#L31-L32).
