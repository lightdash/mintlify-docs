This guide explains how to rename metrics, dimensions, or models across your entire project. All field or model references will be updated across charts, dashboards, and scheduled deliveries. This feature is useful when you need to standardize naming conventions, update your dashboards after making model changes or just fix some typos quickly.

<Warning>
  **Admin access required:** This feature is restricted to admin users because it updates content project-wide, including charts and dashboards that users may not have access to modify.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Content can also be renamed using [Dashboards as code](/references/dashboards-as-code). However, the rename methods in this doc require fewer steps and will automatically respect the right syntax for different field types. 

  Chart names and descriptions will not be updated using these rename workflows. If you want to update those in bulk, we recommend using Dashboards as code.

## Rename in Lightdash

If you change field or table names in dbt that are being used in Lightdash, you will receive validation errors. You can fix these directly on the validation page by renaming references in the broken charts. You can easily access the validation page by clicking on the bell on the navigation bar. [Read the validation docs here](/references/validating-your-content).
