# Test Auto-Fix Demo

This is a test page to demonstrate the auto-fix workflow.

## Intentionally Misplaced Image

The image below is in the wrong directory (`images/wrong-location/`) instead of `images/guides/test-auto-fix/`:

![Demo Screenshot](/images/wrong-location/demo-screenshot.png)

## What Should Happen

1. The validation bot should detect this image is in the wrong location
2. It should comment on the PR with details
3. We can trigger the auto-fix bot to automatically fix it
4. The bot will move the image and update this reference

Let's see it in action!
