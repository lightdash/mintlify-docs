# Test Auto-Fix Demo

This is a test page to demonstrate the auto-fix workflow.

## Intentionally Misplaced Image

The image below is in the wrong directory (`images/wrong-location/`) instead of `images/guides/test-auto-fix/`:

![Demo Screenshot](/images/wrong-location/demo-screenshot.png)

## What Should Happen

1. The validation bot should detect this image is in the wrong location
2. It should comment on the PR with a simple auto-fix button
3. Click the button to trigger the auto-fix bot
4. The bot will move the image and update this reference automatically

Let's see the simplified workflow in action!
