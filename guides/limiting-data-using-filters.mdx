descritpion: Filters appear at the top of the Explore view or dashboard and allow users to change the data being pulled into your charts.
---

Filters let you narrow down the data displayed in your charts. For example, if you built a chart showing revenue over time, you could add a filter for `country is equal to France` to see only French revenue.

You can add filters to individual charts in the Explore view or apply them across all charts in a dashboard.

<Info>
Developers can add permanent filters to tables using the `sql_filter` yaml option. See [Table configuration](/references/tables#sql-filter) for details.
</Info>

## Quick start

### Adding filters in Explore view

Add filters to charts in three ways:

- **From the Filters tab**: Click the Filters toggle, then `add filter`
- **From the sidebar**: Click the options menu on any field and select `add filter`
- **From the results table**: Click the three-dot menu on a column or click directly on a value

### Adding filters to dashboards

**Temporary filters** (visible only to you):
- Click `add filter` while viewing the dashboard
- Or use cross-filtering by clicking on chart values

**Saved filters** (visible to everyone):
- Enter edit mode by clicking `Edit Dashboard`
- Click `add filter` and configure your filter
- Click `Save` to apply the filter for all users

## Filter capabilities reference

### Multiple filters

| Feature | How to use |
|---------|-----------|
| Add multiple filters | Click `+ Add filter` |
| Combine with AND logic | Select `ALL` conditions from the dropdown |
| Combine with OR logic | Select `ANY` conditions from the dropdown |
| Add multiple values | Press `enter` between each value |

### Nested filters

Create complex filter groups by converting a filter to a group:

1. Click the options button on the right side of any filter
2. Select `convert to group`
3. Add additional filters within the group

### Filter types

For a complete list of available filter operators and their uses, see the [filters reference documentation](/references/filters).


## Dashboard filters

### Temporary vs saved filters

| Filter type | Visibility | When to use |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Temporary** | Only visible to you | Quick exploration without affecting others |
| **Saved** | Visible to all dashboard viewers | Set default filters for the entire team |

<Info>
Temporary filter values are reverted when entering dashboard edit mode.
</Info>

### Adding temporary filters

**Using the add filter button:**

1. Click `add filter` while viewing the dashboard
2. Select the field and value to filter by
3. Optionally adjust which tiles the filter applies to in the `Tiles` tab

**Using cross-filtering:**

Click on any value in a chart to filter the entire dashboard by that value.

### Adding saved filters

1. Click `Edit Dashboard` to enter edit mode
2. Click `add filter` and select your field
3. Configure the filter:
   - **Leave value blank**: Dashboard viewers can set their own values
   - **Set a default value**: Toggle 'Default value' and specify the value
4. Adjust tile application in the `Tiles` tab if needed
5. Click `Apply`, then `Save`

</Frame>

<Info>
You must be an editor or admin to add saved filters.
</Info>

### Marking filters as required

You can require users to set a filter value before the dashboard runs:

1. Edit your filter
2. Check "Require value for dashboard to run"
3. Save the dashboard

<Frame>

</Frame>

Until a value is set, the dashboard will remain locked.

### Controlling filter scope

Use the `Tiles` tab in the filter configuration to:
- Remove the filter from specific tiles
- Change which field the filter applies to in each tile

### SQL Runner chart filters

Dashboard filters work with SQL Runner charts in two ways:

**Mixed dashboards** (Explorer + SQL Runner charts):
- Create filters normally by selecting a field
- In the `Chart tiles` tab, apply the filter to SQL chart tiles and choose the column

**SQL-only dashboards**:
- Choose a column from all available columns across charts
- Provide a filter label for clarity
- Select your operator and values
- By default, applies to all columns with the same name

<Info>
Filters only apply to dimensions (non-aggregated columns) in SQL Runner charts.
</Info>

## Dashboard filter behavior

### Filter visibility

Tiles with filters applied show `dashboard filter applied` text. Hover over this to see which specific filters are active.

</Frame>

### Filter precedence

Dashboard filters override saved chart filters on the same field.

**Example**: A saved chart filtered to `country is China, India, Japan` with a dashboard filter of `country is India` will only show India data.

**When exploring from a dashboard**:
- `Explore from here` preserves dashboard filter overrides
- `Edit` shows the original chart filters

### Sharing with filter overrides

Share dashboards with custom filter values from view mode:
- Apply temporary filters or override saved filters
- Copy the URL to share with filters applied

**Override rules**:
- **Temporary filters**: Can change field, value, operator, and tiles
- **Saved filter overrides**: Can only change value and operator
- Saving changes in edit mode removes overrides

This behavior applies to scheduled deliveries and exports.

### Filter autocomplete

Filter autocomplete considers all relevant filters from joined tables.

**Example**:
```yaml
- name: customers
---
- name: orders
  meta:
    joins:
      - join: customers
        sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
---
- name: payments
  meta:
    joins:
      - join: orders
        sql_on: ${orders.order_id} = ${payments.order_id}
      - join: customers
        sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
```

When filtering:
- `payments` fields: considers filters from payments, orders, and customers
- `orders` fields: considers filters from orders and customers
- `customers` fields: considers filters from customers only
