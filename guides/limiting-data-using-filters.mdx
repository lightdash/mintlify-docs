descritpion: Filters appear at the top of the Explore view or dashboard and allow users to change the data being pulled into your charts.
---

Filters let you narrow down the data displayed in your charts. For example, if you built a chart showing revenue over time, you could add a filter for `country is equal to France` to see only French revenue.

You can add filters to individual charts in the Explore view or apply them across all charts in a dashboard.

<Info>
Developers can add permanent filters to tables using the `sql_filter` yaml option. See [Table configuration](/references/tables#sql-filter) for details.
</Info>

## Quick start

### Adding filters in Explore view

Add filters to charts in three ways:

- **From the Filters tab**: Click the Filters toggle, then `add filter`
- **From the sidebar**: Click the options menu on any field and select `add filter`
- **From the results table**: Click the three-dot menu on a column or click directly on a value

### Adding filters to dashboards

**Temporary filters** (visible only to you):
- Click `add filter` while viewing the dashboard
- Or use cross-filtering by clicking on chart values

**Saved filters** (visible to everyone):
- Enter edit mode by clicking `Edit Dashboard`
- Click `add filter` and configure your filter
- Click `Save` to apply the filter for all users

## Filter capabilities reference

## Adding filters to your dashboard

There are a couple of ways that you can add filters to your Dashboards.

### Adding temporary filters to your dashboard

If you add a temporary filter to your dasboard, then only you will see the filters you've applied (you won't be changing the dashboard for everyone who comes to look at it). If you want to save the dashboard filters you're adding, then check out [adding saved filters to your dashboard](#adding-saved-filters-to-your-dashboard).

There are two ways to add temporary filters to your dashboard.

##### Adding temporary filters using the `add filters` button

1. Open up your dashboard.
2. Click `add filter`, then specify the field that you want to filter on and the value you want to filter by.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-temporary-filter-add-new-de0bc7bd337efb6669034882acf22249.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

3. If you want, you can adjust which tiles the filter is applied to by clicking on the `Tiles` tab.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-temporary-filter-add-tile-272b8237fca39deed799c9911dfead73.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

You can remove the filter from a certain tile, or you can change which field the filter is applied to in a tile.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-temporary-filter-add-tile-edit-5b99bc520ea2f5c75926a2dd374eafc4.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

4. And voilà! Your filters will pop up on the top of your dashboard.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-temporary-filter-view-224e1eec6ee51e6a34496e07428fd51e.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

<Info>
Values for temporary and overriden saved filters are reverted when entering Dashboard edit mode.
</Info>

##### `Cross filtering` your dashboard using values in your tiles

Cross-filtering lets you interact with one chart and apply that interaction as a filter to other charts in the dashboard. You can filter the dashboard using cross filtering by:

1. Clicking on one of the values in the chart.
2. Selecting the value you want to filter on from the drop-down list.

### Adding saved filters to your dashboard

If you add a saved filter to your dashboard, then anyone that opens the dashboard will see the saved filters applied.

To add saved filters, you just:

1. Open up your dashboard.
2. Make sure you're in `edit` mode (if you're not, you should see the option to click `Edit Dashboard`)
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/edit-dashboard-243a6491ee8a29a8c824195bbc31e2bf.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

3. Click `add filter`, then specify the dimension or metric that you want to filter on.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-temporary-filter-add-new-de0bc7bd337efb6669034882acf22249.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

4. You can leave the value blank, or you can specify a value that you want to filter by:

If you leave the value blank, then no filter will be applied to the tiles in your dashboard. Importantly, this provides dashboard viewers the option to define a value in the filter, enabling them to tailor the results to their needs.

  <img src="/images/guides/add-filter-dashboard-empty-value-a1f50ba890bd490b55a27c2e6f9e0398.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

If you want to specify a value, ensure you toggle 'Default value' so that you can apply a filter to the tiles in your dashboard.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/add-filter-dashboard-default-value-765a13d8e7bfc6e72418e845d1dedef2.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

5. If you want, you can adjust which tiles the filter is applied to by clicking on the `Tiles` tab.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/filter-tiles-tab-4e0da6245fbdaef681413eaede8c6a7a.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>


You can remove the filter from a certain tile, or you can change which field the filter is applied to in a tile.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-temporary-filter-add-tile-edit-5b99bc520ea2f5c75926a2dd374eafc4.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

6. Click `apply`, and your filters will pop up on the top of your dashboard.

  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-filters-ready-to-be-saved-361a01d7027a59f41c9422149fc92edf.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

7. Once you have all of the filters you want, just hit `save` to save your filter settings.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/save-new-filters-dashboard-2883937f3e63c018e926b12aa964ade6.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

Now, whenever someone opens the dashboard, they'll see your saved filters applied!
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-filters-saved-517f21a3d5aebe75b0635e30955f342a.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

And if they want to drill-down into the data, they can always change the filters by clicking on the filter and adjusting the values.

### Filtering charts created in the SQL Runner

Dashboard filters can be applied to SQL Runner-based charts as well as charts from the Explorer. There are two different ways this can be done:

- On a dashboard with both Explorer and SQL Runner charts, filters are created the same way as above — you choose a field and create a filter.  
  Then, in the **Chart tiles** tab, you can apply the filter to a SQL chart tile and choose the column you want that filter to apply to.

- On a dashboard with **only** SQL Runner-based tiles, filters are created a little differently since SQL charts are based on columns instead of semantic fields.

#### To create a filter on a dashboard with only SQL charts:

1. Choose a column from the list of all columns available across all charts.
2. Choose a filter label to give your filter a recognizable name.
3. Choose your filter operator and values as you would for any other filter.

By default, the new filter will be applied to every column on the dashboard that has the same name as the filtered column. 
You can also choose, in the **Chart tiles** tab of the filter dropdown, exactly which tiles and columns to apply it to.

Note that as with Explorer-chart filters, you can only apply fitlers to dimensions (in this case, non-aggregated columns).

### Some things worth mentioning about dashboard filters

##### Sharing your dashboard with overrides

You might want to share a dashboard with someone with custom filters applied. To do this, you have to be in _view mode_. Then, you can either/or:

1. Apply temporary filters to your dashboard and share the link with the filters applied.
2. Apply changes(overrides) to your saved filters and share the link with the filters applied.

Rules for sharing dashboards with filters applied:

* In view mode and when adding a temporary filter, you can change the field, value, operator, and tiles this is applied to. But, you can't change the filter type (e.g. from `temporary filter` to `saved filter`).
* In view mode and when overriding a saved filter, you can only change the value and operator, so the field and tile configuration will remain the same.
* In edit mode, when changing a saved filter (with an override present), once you save the changes (click "Apply"), the override for that filter will be removed.

The same behaviour applies when exporting dashboards or sending them to email or Slack in [scheduled deliveries](/guides/how-to-create-scheduled-deliveries).

##### You can easily see which dashboard tiles have which filters applied to them

If a tile in a dashboard has a filter applied to it, you'll see the text `dashboard filter applied` on the tile.

You can also hover over this to see **_which_** filters have been applied to that tile.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/dashboard-filter-applied-849b4b24b8ab77215ddb46bcd6735720.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>


##### Dashboard filters override filters applied in a saved chart on the same field

For example, if I had a chart for Sales in Asia and I filtered to `country` **is** `China`, `India`, `Japan`. Then, on my dashboard I added a filter `country` **is** `India`. My saved chart's filter would be removed, and my new dashboard filter would be applied instead, so the tile in the dashboard would be filtered to: `country` **is** `India`.

Here's another example using a date filter: If my original saved chart was filtered to only include orders completed on or after April 3rd, 2024\. But, I add a date filter to my dashboard to include orders completed on or after August 1st, 2024, then the dashboard filter would override the saved chart filter and I'll end up with the chart filtered by orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022.

**How charts work in this context:**

* When you **Explore from here** from a dashboard, the chart will include the same filters you saw on the Dashboard version. Any filters overriden in the dahsboard will be overriden in the **Explore from here** view. Filters NOT overriden in the dashboad will be the same as they were in the original chart.
* If you 'Edit' the chart instead of explore from here, you will see the original chart filters.

Here's another example using a date filter: If my original saved chart was filtered to only include orders completed on or after April 3rd, 2022\. But, I add a date filter to my dashboard to include orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022, then the dashboard filter would be added to the saved chart filter and I'll end up with the chart filtered by orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022.

##### Dashboard filters autocomplete

When determining possible values for a dashboard filter, the system will take into account all relevant filters, including those applied to fields from joined tables.

Example with payments and orders models:

```yaml
- name: customers
---
- name: orders
  meta:
    joins:
      - join: customers
        sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
---
- name: payments
  meta:
    joins:
      - join: orders
        sql_on: ${orders.order_id} = ${payments.order_id}
      - join: customers
        sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
```

Following this example:

* when filtering on a field from the `payments` model, the system will consider the filters applied to fields from the `payments`, `orders` and `customers` models
* when filtering on a field from the `orders` model, the system will consider the filters applied to fields from the `orders` and `customers` models
* when filtering on a field from the `customers` model, the system will consider the filters applied to fields from the `customers` model
