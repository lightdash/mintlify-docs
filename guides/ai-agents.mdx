AI agents automatically select the most relevant data models and metrics to answer your questions, build and execute queries with appropriate dimensions, metrics, and filters, and present results in the most insightful format.

<Info>
AI Agents in the Lightdash app will follow row-level, column-level, and table-level data access based on [user attributes](/references/user-attributes).

In Slack, the AI will have the user attributes of the user who set up the agent. We plan to respect user attributes based on Slack user email in the future, reach out if you need that feature!

## Get started

Getting started with AI agents is simple - you can begin using them right away on any project in your Lightdash instance.

### Creating your first AI agent

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/ai-agent-create.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

1. **Find the "Ask AI" button** in your project - this will be your entry point to AI agents
2. **Create a new agent** (only admins and developers can create new AI agents)
3. **Configure your agent:**

   - **Name and image** - Give your agent a memorable name and visual identity
   - **Instructions (optional)** - Provide context about your models, tables, or specific use cases to help the AI give more relevant responses. Some templates are provided to get you started.
   - **Enable Data Access (optional)** - Enable data access to allow your agent to analyze actual query results and provide insights based on the data. When disabled, agents work with metadata only
   - **Enable Self-Improvement (optional, Beta)** - Allow your agent to propose changes to your semantic layer, including updating descriptions and creating new metrics. Changes are tracked in changesets for review
   - **User and Group Access (optional)** - Control which users and groups can access your agent through the agent settings
   - **Tags (optional)** - Use dbt tags to control which metrics and dimensions the agent can access
   - **Slack Integration (optional)** - Connect your agent to Slack channels so users can interact directly from Slack

Once set up, you can start asking questions immediately! Try asking "What kind of data can you access?" to get started.

## What agents can do

### Core capabilities

AI agents in Lightdash allow you to:

- **Ask questions in natural language** - Simply type what you want to know about your data, like "What's our total revenue by region?" or "Show me user growth over the last 6 months"
- **Get instant visualizations** - Receive bar charts, time series, and tables automatically generated based on your questions
- **Explore interactively** - Follow up with additional questions, drill down into specific data points, or request different chart types
- **Maintain conversation context** - AI agents remember your conversation history, so you can build on previous questions and refine your analysis
- **Provide text-only responses** - Get answers in natural language when visualizations aren't needed
- **Guide you to the right data** - Direct you to the most relevant explores or tables for your questions
- **Discover existing content** - Find and share relevant charts and dashboards that have already been created in your project
- **Generate complete dashboards** - Create multiple related visualizations at once that tell a cohesive story about your data, perfect for executive summaries or thematic analyses

As mentioned earlier, Lightdash agents use the **semantic layer** defined in your dbt models to understand your data structure, relationships, and business logic.
This ensures that the AI generates accurate queries and visualizations based on your specific data context.
So, *when an Agent generates an answer, the output is a semantic query, **not SQL!*** This means that you can easily swap between the conversational AI interface and the standard Lightdash exploration experience.

### Using AI agents in Slack

Connect your AI agents to Slack for collaborative data analysis and team-wide insights sharing, here's how:

1. Select or create an AI agent in your Lightdash instance
2. Add the [Slack integration](https://docs.lightdash.com/guides/using-slack-integration#using-the-slack-integration) in your organization settings
3. Under 'Integrations', add the channel you want to use
   {" "}
   <Frame>
     <img src="/images/guides/ai-agent-set-slack-channel.png" alt="" />
   </Frame>
4. Tag your **Slack App** in the channel you want to use
5. Start asking questions like "What kind of data can you access?" or "Show me total order amount over time"
6. Get instant results directly in Slack

You can also summon the bot on a thread to continue the conversation. In order for the bot to be able to respond, you need enable this context sharing in your Lightdash Integrations settings.

## Agent memory and learning

<Info>Agent memory can be modified by admins and developers only</Info>

AI agents can now learn from your corrections and feedback. When you correct an agent's response or guide it to better understand your data, the agent can automatically update its own instructions to remember these preferences for future conversations. The memory will only be saved if you approve the agent's suggested learning.

### How it works

- When an agent makes a mistake or you provide clarification, it can capture this feedback
- The agent updates its instructions field with the new learning
- All future conversations with that agent will benefit from this accumulated knowledge
- Memories are stored directly in the agent's instructions, which you can view and edit in agent settings

### What agents can learn

Agents can learn various types of corrections and preferences:

- **Which tables or explores to use** for specific types of queries
- **Field selection preferences** like "always use net_revenue instead of gross_revenue when generating revenue charts"
- **Filter logic** such as "exclude test accounts when counting customers"
- **General preferences** about formatting, ordering, or analysis approaches

## Self-Improvement

<Warning>
  This feature is currently in Beta. Enable it in your agent settings to start
  testing with your team.
</Warning>

AI agents can now improve your semantic layer by proposing changes to your data models. When enabled, agents can update field descriptions, create new metrics, and refine your data documentation based on conversations and user feedback. All changes are tracked in changesets and can be reviewed or reverted at any time.

### How it works

When self-improvement is enabled, your AI agent can:

1. **Propose changes** to your semantic layer during conversations
2. **Apply changes immediately** to a changeset (batch of changes)
3. **Track all modifications** with full history and attribution
4. **Allow review and rejection** of changes by authorized users

Changes are visible in the chat interface and can be managed through the Project Settings > Changesets page.

      src="/images/guides/ai-agents/self-improvement-chat-2.png"
      alt="Self-improvement changes in chat custom metric"
    />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

### What agents can improve

**Update descriptions** for better documentation:

- Explore descriptions to clarify data sources and use cases
- Metric descriptions to explain calculations and business logic
- Dimension descriptions to provide field context

**Create new metrics** based on conversations:

- Custom aggregations derived from existing dimensions

### Enabling self-improvement

To enable self-improvement for an agent:

1. Go to your agent settings
2. Toggle the "Enable Self-Improvement" switch
3. Save your changes

<Accordion title="How to enable self-improvement">
  <Frame>
    <img
      src="/images/guides/ai-agents/enable-self-improvement.png"
      alt="Enable self-improvement toggle"
    />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

<Info>Only admins and developers can enable and use self-improvement</Info>

### Managing changes

All proposed changes are tracked in changesets, which you can access from Project Settings:

**View all changes:**

- Navigate to Project Settings > Changesets
- See a complete list of proposed changes with details about what was modified
- View who proposed each change and when

<Accordion title="Viewing changes in changeset view from project settings">
  <Frame>
    <img
      src="/images/guides/ai-agents/changeset-view.png"
      alt="Self-improvement changes in changeset view from project settings"
    />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

**Review changes in chat:**

- Each proposed change appears as a card in the conversation
- Click "View Changeset" to see the full details
- Use the "Reject" button to revert changes you don't want

**Revert changes:**

- Individual changes can be rejected directly from the chat interface
- Use "Revert" in the changesets page to undo specific changes
- Use "Revert All" to undo multiple changes at once
- If a project is re-deployed, the changeset will be applied if possible

<Warning>
  Once a change is reverted, the action cannot be undone. The semantic layer
  will return to its previous state for that field or metric.
</Warning>

## Best practices

To get the most accurate and useful answers from your AI agents, follow these best practices for preparing your data and configuring your agents.

### Think specialized, not general

Think of AI agents as your specialized analysts - each one can be configured to focus on specific areas of your business. For example, you might create a "Marketing Assistant" that only has access to marketing data like campaign performance, lead generation, and customer acquisition metrics. This focused approach ensures more accurate, relevant responses and prevents sensitive data from being accessible to the wrong teams. To find out more about how to configure specific access, see [Limiting access to specific explores/fields](#limiting-access-to-specific-explores/fields).

### Document your data thoroughly

Good documentation is crucial for AI to understand your data models and provide meaningful insights. The quality of the results depend on the quality of your metadata and documentation.

- **Write clear, descriptive names** for metrics and dimensions
- **Add detailed descriptions** to all metrics and dimensions explaining what they represent
- **Include example questions** in descriptions that AI could answer with the metric
- **Use AI hints** to provide additional context specifically for AI agents

Remember: If your colleague wouldn't understand your documentation, neither will the AI agent. The more context you provide, the better the AI can interpret and analyze your data.

#### Using AI hints

AI hints are specialized metadata fields that provide additional context specifically for AI agents. These hints help the AI better understand your data models, business logic, and how to interpret your metrics and dimensions.
