## Adding Slack to your organization

Add the Slack integration by navigating to **Organization settings**, then **Integrations**. Click on **Add to Slack**.

This will open a confirmation page to give permission to the Lightdash Slack App to access your Lightdash and Slack Organizations. If you're not a Slack admin you might need to request approval to add the app.

Once the app is approved, you're all set! Watch the video below to see the step-by-step process.
