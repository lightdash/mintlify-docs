Period-over-period analysis is one of the most common ways to evaluate how metrics change over time. Whether you're looking at **month-over-month growth**, **year-over-year comparisons**, or **week-over-week performance**, Lightdash makes it easy to build these analyses directly in your dashboards.

This guide walks through several examples of how to do period-over-period analysis in Lightdash. You can also watch the video walkthrough if you'd prefer a visual demo.

## Big Value Charts: Simple Comparisons

The fastest way to get started is with the **Big Value** chart type.


### Month-over-month

- Pull two months of data.  
- Use the Big Value chart and select **Compare to previous row**  
- Lightdash automatically shows the comparison.

That's it!


### Same month, previous Year

- Pull ~13 months of data with `MONTH` and `MONTH_NUM` time dimensions and your metric.
- Create a table calculation to filter only the current month and the same month last year:

```sql
(extract(month from current_date) - 1) = ${tracks.timestamp_month_num}
```

_This table calculation relies on the `MONTH_NUM` [time interval](/references/dimensions#numeric-options)._

- Filter where the value of this table calculation is `true`.  
- Then use the Big Value chart with **Compare to previous row**


## Trend line comparisons

Sometimes you need more than a single valueâ€”you want to see how trends evolve.


### By week of year

- Add **week of year** [time dimension](/references/dimensions#numeric-options) (1-52) on the X-axis.  
- Plot the metric (e.g. `event_count`).
- Group by **year**.  
- This allows you to compare trends across years.

Check minute 1:45 in the Loom video for an example.

<Tip>Bonus: if you want a more business-user-friendly version you can use the table calculation below to add descriptions for each week number to get a chart like this.</Tip>

### By day of month with running totals

- Compare June vs July (or any two months).  
- Use **day of month** [time dimension](/references/dimensions#numeric-options) (1-31) on the X-axis, grouped by month.
- Add a running total table calculation.
- Optionally, use bars in the background to show cumulative progress.

Check minute 2:30 in the Loom video for an example.


## Compare arbitrary weeks

You can also compare arbitrary weeks side by side.

- Select specific weeks (e.g. 2, 8, 12).  
- Use **week of year** as the grouping dimension.  
- Apply a running total to see how each week accumulates.
- This shows how different weeks trend across the same range.

Check minute 3:00 in the Loom video for an example.


## Year-over-year by month

For a full year-over-year comparison across months:

1. Pull two years worth of monthly of data.  
2. Use the `lag()` function in a table calculation to find the value from the same month last year:

```sql
lag(${event_count}, 12)
```

3. Create a percent change calculation:

```sql
(${event_count} - ${previous_year_value}) / ${previous_year_value}
```

4. Filter out rows where `previous_year_value` is `null`.

Check minute 3:45 in the Loom video for an example.
