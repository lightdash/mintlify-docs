## What can you embed?

Lightdash supports embedding two types of content, each designed for different use cases:

### Dashboards

Embed complete dashboards with multiple visualizations, filters, and tabs. Perfect for providing comprehensive analytics views in your application.

**Use cases:**
- Executive dashboards in admin panels
- Customer-facing analytics portals
- Embedded reporting for SaaS applications

[Learn more about embedding dashboards →](/guides/embedding/dashboards)

### Charts

Embed individual saved charts for focused, single-metric displays. Charts provide a minimal UI for clean integration.

**Use cases:**
- Single KPI widgets in applications
- Embedded metrics in marketing pages
- Focused analytics in workflows

<Info>
Chart embedding requires the React SDK. iframe embedding is only available for dashboards.

## How can you embed content?

Lightdash offers two embedding methods:

**[iframe embedding](/references/iframe-embedding)**: Embed Lightdash **dashboards** using a simple iframe with a JWT in the URL. No special integration required. iframe embedding is only available for dashboards, not charts.

**[React SDK](/references/react-sdk)**: Use the `@lightdash/sdk` package for seamless integration in React applications. The React SDK supports both dashboards and charts with additional features like programmatic filters and callbacks.

Both methods use the same JWT-based authentication and security model.

## Quick start: Embed a dashboard

This quick start will walk you through embedding your first dashboard using an iframe.

### Step 1: Create an embed secret

First, you need to generate a secret per project. This secret is like a password that will help you encrypt the URLs so we know the access is valid.

</Frame>

You can regenerate the secret by clicking on the `Generate new secret` button. If you do this, people with an old URL will automatically lose access to any previously shared embed URL.

### Step 2: Add allowed dashboards

Only selected dashboards can be accessed via embed URLs. Add the dashboard you want to embed to the allowed list.

### Step 3: Configure and preview

Under the "Configure" section, you can:
- Select which dashboard to embed
- Set token expiration time
- Configure interactivity (filters, exports, etc.)
- Add user attributes for row-level security

</Frame>

Click on `Preview` to see how the embedded content will look, and click on `Generate & copy URL` to get a one-off embed URL for testing.

### Step 4: Generate tokens programmatically

Although you can generate URLs directly from Lightdash with a long expiration, it is recommended to generate your own JWTs in your backend with a short expiration using your `secret` to make sure people can't be using embed URLs outside your app.

Lightdash provides code snippets you can copy and use in your app to generate valid embed URLs:

## Common questions

### Do I need a Lightdash account to view embedded content?

No, embedded Lightdash content is available to view by anyone (not just folks with a Lightdash login).

So, for example, you could embed a dashboard in your product, and anyone who has access to your product would have access to that dashboard. No need to login to Lightdash.

We make sure that the links are secure and have a set expiry time that you pick.

### How does security work?

Embedded content is secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) that you sign with your embed secret. The token includes:

- What content to display (dashboard or chart)
- Expiration time
- User attributes for row-level filtering
- Permissions for interactivity (filters, exports, etc.)

Tokens are short-lived and should be generated server-side to prevent exposure of your embed secret.

### Can I show different data to different users?

Yes! You can use [user attributes](/references/workspace/user-attributes) to implement row-level security in your embedded content. This allows you to filter data based on the viewing user's properties (e.g., tenant ID, region, etc.).
