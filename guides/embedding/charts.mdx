## Overview

Chart embedding allows you to display single saved charts from Lightdash in your application with a minimal, focused interface. Unlike dashboard embedding, chart embeds are scoped to a specific chart and provide a clean, distraction-free view of a single visualization.

<Warning>
Chart embedding is **only available via the React SDK**. iframe embedding for charts is not currently supported.
</Warning>

### When to use chart embedding

- **Single KPI displays**: Show one key metric or visualization
- **Embedded widgets**: Add analytics widgets to application pages
- **Marketing pages**: Display metrics on public-facing pages
- **Minimal UI requirements**: When you need a clean, focused display
- **Scoped access**: Grant access to specific charts only, not entire dashboards

### Key differences from dashboard embedding

| Feature | Dashboard Embedding | Chart Embedding |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Embedding method** | iframe or React SDK | React SDK only |
| **Content** | Multiple tiles, tabs | Single chart only |
| **Filters** | Interactive dashboard filters | No filters (pre-configured) |
| **JWT scope** | Dashboard UUID | Scoped to chart UUID |
| **UI** | Full dashboard interface | Minimal chart view |
| **Explore** | Can navigate to explore | Cannot access explore |

### Available features

Chart embedding supports:
- All chart types (bar, line, pie, table, big number, etc.)
- Parameterized charts with pre-set values
- Export to CSV (if enabled)
- Export to PNG/images (if enabled)
- View underlying data (if enabled)

<Warning>
Chart embeds are **read-only**. Users cannot modify the chart configuration, apply filters, or access the underlying data model.
</Warning>

## Setup

### Configure allowed charts

Add the charts you want to embed to your project's embed settings. Navigate to **Settings → Embed** and add specific charts to the allowed list.
