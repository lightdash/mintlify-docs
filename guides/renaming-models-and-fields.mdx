title: "Renaming models, metrics and dimensions"
---

Lightdash provides powerful renaming capabilities that allow you to update metrics, dimensions or  models across your entire project, where those fields or models are used across charts, dashboards and even scheduled deliveries. This feature is particularly useful when you need to standardize naming conventions, fix typos, or make your metrics more user-friendly.

<Info>
  Most of the content can also be renamed using [Dashboards as code](https://docs.lightdash.com/references/dashboards-as-code#dashboards-as-code), however, this method will respect the right syntax for different field types . And more importantly, it will update content that is not exposed on Dashboards as code, like scheduled deliveries.

## **Use Case: Standardizing Field Names**

Imagine you have a field called **user_id** in one model and you want to rename it **customer_id**. If you change this field in dbt, all existing lightdash content will fail, so you might want to rename all the references to that new field in your charts and dashboards. 

## **Renaming via UI**

On the validation page, you can rename failing charts. You can easily access to the validation page by clicking on the bell on the navigation bar.

  title="Screenshot from 2025-05-13 15-48-15.png"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"57%" }}
/>

On the navigation page, over on the chart you want to fix, and click on the **fix** button

A menu will appear, in there you can select to rename a field or a table with an **existing** field or table

  style={{ width:"52%" }}
/>

  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"53%" }}
/>

Optional, you can click **Fix all ocurrences** to rename the same field / table on all content, including other charts, dashboards and scheduled deliveries. 

If you have made mulitple field / table changes to the same chart (eg: you changed 2 metrics), you will have to perform multiple rename actions. 

## **Renaming via CLI**

The Lightdash CLI provides a flexible way to rename models, metrics, or dimensions across your project. This is more advanced option to the UI and affects all the content in the project. The CLI will also allow you to rename content before changes happen to dbt. 

### **Basic Usage**

`lightdash rename --type field --from user_id --to customer_id`

### **Basic options**

- **--type**: Specify what you're renaming (field or model)
- **--from**: The current name you want to change
- **--to**: The new name you want to use
- **--project**: (Optional) Project UUID to target a specific project, if not set, it will used your current project
- **--dry-run**: Test the rename action, no changes will be made. 

Use `lightdash rename --help`  to see all available options. 

### **Example Workflow**

This is a sample of how you can take the most from this feature, when renaminig content on your dbt project. 

- Rename a field in your dbt project YML file: user_id becomes customer_id
- Create a preview environment to test those changes
- Existing charts will fail, you can go into validation to confirm which ones are affected
- Run `lightdash rename --type field --from user_id --to customer_id -p <preview-project-id> --dry-run`  to list the affected charts. 
- If you are happy with the changes, run rename without `--dry-run`
- Confirm all charts are referencing new fields (they might still error if you haven't updated your warehouses using dbt run) 
- Merge the code and run rename on your main project. 

The CLI will show you which charts, dashboards, alerts, and dashboard schedulers will be updated. , and also, we will generate a JSON log that contains the affected chart/dashboard names and UUIDs, you can use those UUIDs to manually revert some of the charts to a previous version.

## **Important Notes**

- Only field ids and references are updated, chart names or descriptions will remain the same. If you want to update that content, we recommend using [Dashboards as code](https://docs.lightdash.com/references/dashboards-as-code#dashboards-as-code).
- Only lowercase letters (a-z) and underscores `_` are allowed in names
- On the CLI, renaming is project-wide by default, but can be scoped to a specific model
- On the CLI, always consider running a **--dry-run** first to understand the impact of your changes
- After renaming, consider running validation to ensure everything works as expected

## Reverting changes 

When renaming, a new chart version is created with the new changes. If you made a mistake renaming, you could run rename again, or you could restore individual charts using [version history](https://docs.lightdash.com/guides/version-history#chart-version-history)
