title: "Renaming models, metrics and dimensions"
description: "Description of your new file."

Lightdash provides powerful renaming capabilities that allow you to update metrics, dimensions or  models across your entire project, where those fields or models are used. This feature is particularly useful when you need to standardize naming conventions, fix typos, or make your metrics more user-friendly.

Renaming updates all the IDs and references from your fields in all charts, dashboards and even scheduled deliveries. New chart versions will be created with this change, if you are not happy with the changes, you can still revert to a previous version on the UI. 

## **Use Case: Standardizing Field Names**

Imagine you have a field called **user_id** in one model and **customer_id** in another, but they represent the same concept. To maintain consistency, you might want to rename all instances of **user_id** to **customer_id** across your entire project.

## **Renaming via UI**

On the validation page, you can rename failing charts 

1. Navigate to your project settings

- Go to the "Validation" tab
- Find the "Rename" section
- Select the type (field, metric, or dimension)
- Enter the current name in the "From" field
- Enter the new name in the "To" field

7. Click "Rename" to execute the change

The UI will display a summary of affected resources before you confirm the change, similar to the CLI's dry run functionality.

## **Important Notes**

- Renaming only affects the display names in Lightdash - it doesn't change your underlying dbt models
- Only lowercase letters (a-z) and underscores (_) are allowed in names_
- Renaming is project-wide by default, but can be scoped to a specific model
- Always consider running a --dry-run first to understand the impact of your changes
- After renaming, consider running validation to ensure everything works as expected

By leveraging Lightdash's renaming capabilities, you can maintain a clean, consistent naming convention throughout your analytics project, improving usability for all team members.

## **Renaming via CLI**

The Lightdash CLI provides a flexible way to rename models, metrics, or dimensions across your project. This is more advanced and affects all the content in the project.

### **Basic Usage**

`lightdash rename --type field --from user_id --to customer_id`

### **Basic options**

- --type: Specify what you're renaming (field or model)
- --from: The current name you want to change
- --to: The new name you want to use
- --project: (Optional) Project UUID to target a specific project
- --dry-run: Test the rename action, no changes will be made. 

Use `lightdash rename --help`  to see all available options. 

### **Example Workflow**

This is a sample of how you can take the most from this feature, when renaminig content on your dbt project. 

- Rename a field in your dbt project YML file: user_id becomes customer_id
- Create a preview environment to test those changes
- Existing charts will fail, you can go into validation to confirm which ones are affected
- Run `lightdash rename --type field --from user_id --to customer_id -p <preview-project-id> --dry-run`  to list the affected charts. 
- If you are happy with the changes, run rename without `--dry-run`
- Confirm all charts are referencing new fields (they might still error if you haven't updated your warehouses using dbt run) 
- Merge the code and run rename on your main project. 

The CLI will show you which charts, dashboards, alerts, and dashboard schedulers will be updated. , and also, we will generate a JSON log that contains the affected chart/dashboard names and UUIDs, you can use those UUIDs to manually revert some of the charts to a previous version.
