description: "The fields that you see in your `dimensions` and `metrics` are created by the people maintaining your Lightdash project. But, you can create new custom dimensions or metrics for quick calculations and binning on the fly. On this page, we'll explain what custom dimensions and metrics are and how to use them."

## Custom metrics

Custom metrics are only saved in the chart they're used in and will not be saved in the list of `metrics` available if you open the same Table to build a new chart. Metrics written to your dbt project (or YAML metrics) are reusable by everyone in your project and will always show up in the side bar of available metrics for a Table. We recommend [writing back custom metrics](/guides/developer/dbt-write-back#write-back-metrics-from-custom-metrics) that you're using/creating frequently so they become reusable, governed and available for everyone else to build from.

To create a custom metric:

1. Click on the dimension's three-dot `options` menu
2. Click on one of the options available (e.g. `Count Distinct`)
3. Confirm your changes
