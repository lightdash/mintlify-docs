You'll need to define the dbt and warehouse connections for your new project.

Not sure what it all means? Don't worry, we've written [a step-by-step guide](/get-started/setup-lightdash/connect-project) that will help you out.

## Easily switch between projects[](#easily-switch-between-projects "Direct link to Easily switch between projects")

Once you've got multiple projects set up, you can easily switch through the projects in your organization using the drop-down list in the top corner of your screen.
