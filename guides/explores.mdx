sidebarTitle: Multiple tables from one model
description: You can use the `explores` configuration in your Lightdash Semantic Layer to curate multiple ways to query from the same table for different audiences.
---


## What this guide covers

You'll learn how to use the `explores` config in Lightdash to define **multiple curated table experiences** from a single dbt model.

Each explore appears as its own table in the **Query from tables** list in Lightdash.

---

## When to use explores

Use the explores config when you want to create tailored versions of the same table for different teams or use cases. For example:

- Show different columns or joins depending on the audience (e.g. Users + CRM for Sales, Users + product usage for PMs)
- Customize each version of the table to match a specific workflow or department
- Restrict access to certain versions or fields using user attributes (e.g. exec-only views, region-based filters, or hiding PII)

## Quickstart


<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with your base model">
    This is your regular dbt model, for example, `deals`.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
        ```yaml
        models:
          - name: deals
            meta:
              primary_key: deal_id
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="dbt v1.10+ and Fusion">
        ```yaml
        models:
          - name: deals
            config:
              meta:
                primary_key: deal_id
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an explores section under meta">

    Use the `explores` config to define multiple versions of the table. Each explore has its own `label`, `joins`, joined fields, and access rules.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
        ```yaml
        models:
          - name: deals
            meta:
              primary_key: deal_id
              label: Deals (Basic)
              description: Basic deals table with no joins
              explores:
                deals_accounts:
                  label: Deals w/Accounts
                  description: Deals table with accounts joined in, limited acount fields included
                  joins:
                    - join: accounts
                      relationship: many-to-one
                      sql_on: ${deals.account_id} = ${accounts.account_id}
                      fields: [industry, segment, count_accounts]
                deals_exec_view:
                  label: Deals (Exec View)
                  description: Deals table with account info, for execs only, all acount fields included
                  required_attributes:
                    is_exec: "true"
                  joins:
                    - join: accounts
                      relationship: many-to-one
                      sql_on: ${deals.account_id} = ${accounts.account_id}
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="dbt v1.10+ and Fusion">

                label: Deals (Basic)
                description: Basic deals table with no joins
                explores:
                  deals_accounts:
                    label: Deals w/Accounts
                    description: Deals table with accounts joined in, limited acount fields included
                    joins:
                      - join: accounts

        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview the result in Lightdash">
    Once you commit and deploy your dbt changes:

    - Go to Query from tables in Lightdash
    - You'll now see:
      - **Deals (Basic)**
      - **Deals w/Accounts**
      - **Deals (Exec View)** (only visible to users with the required attribute)

    Each shows up as its own table in the UI, but all use the same `deals` model.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Table config options you can use

Inside each explore definition, you can use any of the existing table config options, including:

- `label`
- `joins`
- `sql_filter`
- `description`
- `default_filters`
- `required_attributes`
- `additional_dimensions`

[📚 Read the Tables reference docs for all configuration options](/references/tables#table-properties)

## Adding custom dimensions to an explore

Use `additional_dimensions` to define dimensions that are scoped only to a specific explore. This is useful when you need custom dimensions that reference joined tables, which wouldn't make sense at the model level.

### When to use explore-scoped dimensions

- You have multiple explores from the same model with different joins
- You need dimensions that combine fields from the base model and joined tables
- You want to keep explore-specific logic out of the base model

### Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        meta:
          primary_key: order_id
          explores:
            orders_with_custom_dims:
              label: Orders with Custom Dimensions
              joins:
                - join: customers
                  sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.customer_id}
              additional_dimensions:
                full_name:
                  type: string
                  sql: "CONCAT(${customers.first_name}, ' ', ${customers.last_name})"
                  label: Customer Full Name
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+ and Fusion">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        config:
          meta:
            primary_key: order_id
            explores:
              orders_with_custom_dims:
                label: Orders with Custom Dimensions
                joins:
                  - join: customers
                    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.customer_id}
                additional_dimensions:
                  full_name:
                    type: string
                    sql: "CONCAT(${customers.first_name}, ' ', ${customers.last_name})"
                    label: Customer Full Name
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Available properties

Explore-scoped `additional_dimensions` support the same properties as [column-level additional dimensions](/references/dimensions#additional-dimensions):

| Property | Required | Description |
| :------- | :------- | :---------- |
| type | Yes | Dimension type: `string`, `number`, `date`, `timestamp`, or `boolean` |
| sql | Yes | SQL expression for the dimension. Can reference fields from the base model and joined tables using `${table.field}` syntax |
| label | No | Display name in Lightdash |
| description | No | Description shown on hover |
| hidden | No | Set to `true` to hide from the UI |
| format | No | Spreadsheet-style format expression |
| time_intervals | No | For date/timestamp types, specify which intervals to generate |
| groups | No | Group the dimension in the sidebar |
| required_attributes | No | Limit access based on user attributes |
