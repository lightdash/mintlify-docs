## Installation options

**Mac users:** We recommend using Homebrew as it's the easiest installation method and doesn't require installing Node.js separately.

**Windows users or those who prefer NPM:** Use the NPM installation method, which works across all platforms but requires Node.js to be installed first.

You can also download the CLI binary directly from GitHub releases if you prefer not to use a package manager.

## Install via Homebrew

The easiest way to install the Lightdash CLI on Mac is using Homebrew. This method doesn't require you to install Node.js separately:

```bash
brew tap lightdash/lightdash
brew install lightdash
```

## Install via NPM

Before installing Lightdash CLI via NPM, you need to have NodeJS/NPM installed on your machine. To check that, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v; npm -v;
# it should print something like:
# v20.8.0
# 8.15.0
```

<Accordion title="Don't have NodeJS/NPM installed in your system?">
  We recommend installing NodeJS/NPM using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) which works for POSIX-compliant shells (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL)

  Open your terminal and run the command below to install NVM (Node Version Manager) to your system.

  ```bash
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
  # or
  wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
  ```

  Restart terminal and install NodeJS by running

  ```bash
  nvm install --lts
  ```

  Check that NodeJS is installed by running

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  Running the command above should output something like `20.8.0` which means you've succesfully installed NodeJS/NPM <Icon icon="party-horn" iconType="solid" />

  Alternatively, you can [install NodeJS/NPM via your preferred package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
</Accordion>

Run the following on your terminal to install the Lightdash CLI.

```bash
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

<Info>
  If you get an `npm ERR! code EACCES` error while installing the Lightdash CLI, [follow this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) to resolve it.

## Download binary directly

You can also download the CLI binary directly from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash/releases).

## Updating the Lightdash CLI

### Update to the latest version

To update your Lightdash CLI to the latest version, run one of the following depending on how you installed it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Homebrew">
    ```bash
    brew upgrade lightdash
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm update -g @lightdash/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Update to a specific version

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Homebrew">
    Homebrew doesn't support installing specific versions directly. To install a specific version, use npm instead or download the binary from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash/releases).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
    To update (or downgrade) to a specific version of the Lightdash CLI, run:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @lightdash/cli@VERSION_NUMBER
    ```

    Replace `VERSION_NUMBER` with the desired version. For example:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @lightdash/cli@0.1743.1
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  You can check your current CLI version by running `lightdash --version`.
