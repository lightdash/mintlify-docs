title: "How to install the Lightdash CLI"
description: The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.
---

Before installing Lightdash CLI, you need to have NodeJS/NPM installed on your machine. To check that, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v; npm -v;
# it should print something like:
# v20.8.0
# 8.15.0
```

<Accordion title="Don't have NodeJS/NPM installed in your system?">
  We recommend installing NodeJS/NPM using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) which works for POSIX-compliant shells (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL)

  Open your terminal and run the command below to install NVM (Node Version Manager) to your system.

  ```bash
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
  # or
  wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
  ```

  Restart terminal and install NodeJS by running

  ```bash
  nvm install --lts
  ```

  Check that NodeJS is installed by running

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  Running the command above should output something like `20.8.0` which means you've succesfully installed NodeJS/NPM <Icon icon="party-horn" iconType="solid" />

  Alternatively, you can [install NodeJS/NPM via your preferred package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
