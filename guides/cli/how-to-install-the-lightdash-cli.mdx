description: The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

Before installing Lightdash CLI, you need to have NodeJS/NPM installed on your machine. To check that, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v; npm -v;
# it should print something like:
# v20.8.0
# 8.15.0
```

<Accordion title="Don't have NodeJS/NPM installed in your system?">
  We recommend installing NodeJS/NPM using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) which works for POSIX-compliant shells (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL)

  Open your terminal and run the command below to install NVM (Node Version Manager) to your system.

  ```bash
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
  # or
  wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
  ```

  Restart terminal and install NodeJS by running

  ```bash
  nvm install --lts
  ```

  Check that NodeJS is installed by running

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  Running the command above should output something like `20.8.0` which means you've succesfully installed NodeJS/NPM <Icon icon="party-horn" iconType="solid" />

  Alternatively, you can [install NodeJS/NPM via your preferred package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
