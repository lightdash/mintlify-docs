## Login[​](#login "Direct link to Login")

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. If you use your email + password in the browser, login with your email and password.">
    To login to your Lightdash instance run the following command and provide your login email and password:

    ```
    lightdash login https://{{ lightdash_domain }}
    ```

    where `{{ lightdash_domain }}` is the address for your running Lightdash instance. For example Lightdash cloud users in the US would type `lightdash login https://app.lightdash.cloud` if you're in Europe you'd type `lightdash login https://eu1.lightdash.cloud`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. If you use single sign-on (SSO) in the browser, login with a personal access token.">
    First, you'll need to create a new personal access token in the UI by going to Settings > Personal Access Tokens. You can't use an existing personal access token! You have to create a new one just for yourself.

    \{' '}

    Then, run the following command in your project:

    ```
    lightdash login https://{{ lightdash_domain }} --token
    ```

    where `https://my-lightdash.domain.com` is the address for your running Lightdash instance. For example Lightdash cloud users in the US would type `lightdash login https://app.lightdash.cloud` if you're in Europe you'd type `lightdash login https://eu1.lightdash.cloud`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. If you're running in a CI/CD pipeline, login with environment variables">
    You can use the following environment variables to authenticate yourself on each command:

    * **LIGHTDASH\_API\_KEY** a personal access token you can generate in the app under the user settings
    * **LIGHTDASH\_URL** address for your running Lightdash instance
    * **LIGHTDASH\_PROXY\_AUTHORIZATION** if your Lightdash instance is behind a proxy like [Cloud IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap) you can set here `Proxy-Authentication` header value

    Example:

    ```
    LIGHTDASH_API_KEY=946fedb74003405646867dcacf1ad345 LIGHTDASH_URL="https://{{ lightdash_domain }}" LIGHTDASH_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" lightdash preview
    ```

    Where `{{ lightdash_domain }}` is your domain. For Lightdash Cloud users use `https://app.lightdash.cloud`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Set active project[​](#set-active-project "Direct link to Set active project")

When you login you'll be asked to set an active project.

Your active project is just the one that you're working on/developing in. Your organization might just have one project, so that makes your decision easy!

You can change your active project by running:

```
lightdash config set-project
```

Or you can use the `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT` environment variable to indicate what project UUID the command should use.

Example:

```
LIGHTDASH_PROJECT="3675b69e-8324-4110-bdca-059031aa8da3" lightdash deploy
```

## Now that you've logged in, you're ready to use the CLI\![​](#now-that-youve-logged-in-youre-ready-to-use-the-cli "Direct link to Now that you've logged in, you're ready to use the CLI!")

You can see all of the actions available on the CLI by typing this in your terminal:

```
lightdash
```
