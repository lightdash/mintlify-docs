You can trigger a validation on a project using the Lightdash CLI so you can check locally if your changes will break anything. You can also add `lightdash validate` to your [GitHub Actions](#configure-github-actions) so changes can't be merged unless they pass the validation.

## Usage

### Validate only specific elements of your project

You can select which parts of your project you would like to validate using the `--only` argument.

```bash
lightdash validate --only tables charts dashboards
```

Available options:

* `tables`

* `charts`

* `dashboards`

## Configure Github actions

This command will create a preview environment, and then validate this preview by specifying `--preview` on the validate command.`lightdash validate` will return an error (return code 1) if there is at least 1 validation error on your project. You can use this output to block a deploy on Github actions like this

```yaml
- name: Start preview
  run: lightdash start-preview
- name: Validate preview
  run: lightdash validate --preview
```
