## Automatically create a preview environment on your pull requests using Github action

If you've connected Lightdash to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Lightdash to create new dynamic `preview` projects automatically when a new `pull request` is created, and it will automatically delete the `preview` project when the `pull request` is closed or merged.

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets

If you haven't already set up a GitHub action for Lightdash, you'll need to add some secrets to GitHub. If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action.

We are going to add some secrets and config to GitHub actions, but you don't want those to be public, so the best way to do this is to add them as secrets on Github.

<Info>
  If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action.
</Info>

Go to your repo, click on `Settings` , on the left sidebar, click on `Secrets` under `Security`. Now click on the `New repository secret`

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/cli/github-secrets-fc35152c7ebb768974b385a0e2601dc5.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

We need to add the following secrets:

##### `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`

Create a new personal access token, by going to `Settings` > `Personal Access Tokens`. This is the token you'll put in for `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`.

  <img src="/images/guides/cli/personal-access-token-9ed8a8c2b16edc5ee745c4909d4093d3.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

##### `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`

The UUID for your project. For example, if your URL looks like [`https://eu1.lightdash.cloud/projects/3538ab33-dc90-aabb-bc00-e50bba3a5f69/tables`](https://eu1.lightdash.cloud/projects/3538ab33-dc90-aabb-bc00-e50bba3a5f69/tables), then `3538ab33-dc90-45f0-aabb-e50bba3a5f69` is your `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`

##### `LIGHTDASH_URL`

This is either [`https://eu1.lightdash.cloud`](https://eu1.lightdash.cloud) or [`https://app.lightdash.cloud`](https://app.lightdash.cloud) for Lightdash Cloud users (check the URL to your Lightdash project). If you self-host, this should be your own custom domain.

##### `DBT_PROFILES`

Some tips for this bit:

* You might be able to copy a bunch of the information from your local `profiles.yml` file. You can see what's in there by typing `cat ~/.dbt/profiles.yml` in your terminal.

* If you have a separate `prod` and `dev` profile, you probably want to use the information from your `prod` profile for your GitHub action.

* If you want to have different connection settings depending on the user that opened the pull request (dev profiles), then [check out this guide](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview#how-to-use-the-developer-credentials-in-your-preview-project).

Find your data warehouse from the list below to get a profiles.yml file template. Fill out this template, and this is your `DBT_PROFILES` secret.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="BigQuery">
    BigQuery OAuth:

    Step 1: create a secret called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

    Create a service account with the role `BigQuery User`. Add the service account credentials (the JSON file) that you want to use for your GitHub action. It should look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "jaffle_shop",
      "private_key_id": "12345",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ... -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": "jaffle_shop@jaffle_shop.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "client_id": "12345",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/jaffle_shop"
    }
    ```

    Step 2: create another secret called `DBT_PROFILES`

    Copy-paste this template into the secret and fill out the details.

    This will always use this project connection in your GitHub actions. If you want your preview projects to have different connection settings depending on the user that opened the pull request (dev profiles), then see what you need to add to your secret [in this guide](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview#how-to-use-the-developer-credentials-in-your-preview-project).

### Step 2: Create start-preview.yml and close-preview.yml workflows in Github

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu, and click on `Configure`

![Github actions page](/images/guides/cli/github-actions-f74f88aa1b1413a111be7dbf16d65d53.png)


If you have some GitHub actions in your repo already, click on `New workflow`, then select `setup a workflow yourself`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/cli/new-workflow-existing-actions-e321bd117d93bf139a01424d3771d0e6.jpg" alt=""/>
</Frame>


Now copy [this start-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/start-preview.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions) repo

And save by clicking on `Start commit`

Do the same with [this close-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/close-preview.yml).

### You're done!

Everytime you create a new `pull request` , a new `preview` project with your `branch` name will be created on your organization. You will see this link as a github-actions bot comment in the `pull request` conversation. Everytime you make a change to that branch, the preview environment will get updated. Once you close or merge your `pull request`, the `preview` project will get deleted.

You can see the log on `Github actions` page

![Github actions stop preview](/images/guides/cli/github-actions-stop-3e0499fdef89b6723e6c17f80553cdaa.png)

## How to use the developer credentials in your preview project

When developing in dbt, you typically have a different set of credentials and dataset/schema than when you are running in production. Here are two options on how to set them up based on the developer that opened the Pull Request.

<Info>
  If you use dbt cloud IDE to create commits and pull requests you need a few extra steps. We need to add a step in the GitHub action to fetch the user that created the pull request.

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/github-script@v6
    id: get_pr_creator
    with:
      script: |
        return (
          await github.rest.repos.listPullRequestsAssociatedWithCommit({
            commit_sha: context.sha,
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
          })
        ).data[0].user.login;
      result-encoding: string

  ```

  When copying the following templates, you should replace `${{ github.actor }}` with `${{steps.get_pr_creator.outputs.result}}`.
</Info>

### Using profile targets

Update your `DBT_PROFILES` to have 1 target per developer. The target name should be their GitHub username.

```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: prod
  outputs:
    prod:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: prod
    katie: # example developer 1, should be GitHub username
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_katie
    jose: # example developer 2
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_jose
```

Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the `--target` flag for the `lightdash start-preview` command.

```yaml
run: lightdash start-preview --project-dir "$PROJECT_DIR" --profiles-dir . --name ${GITHUB_REF##*/} --target ${{ github.actor }}
```

### Using github environments

Setup a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) for each developer where the secrets are specifically for them. The environment name should be their GitHub username. Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the environment.

```yaml
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ github.actor }}
```

## How to use the dbt cloud schema in your preview project

If you are using a [continuous integration job in dbt cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs), you can use the schema that is created by dbt cloud (`dbt_cloud_pr_<job_id>_<pr_id>`) for your preview project.

First we need to add an environment variable to your profile.yml file that will be used by dbt to connect to the correct schema.

```yaml
schema: "{{ env_var('DBT_SCHEMA') }}"
```

If you are using BigQuery, it should be `dataset` instead of `schema`.

Then we need to add a step in the GitHub action to fetch the pull request id.

```yaml
- uses: actions/github-script@v6
  id: pr_id
  with:
    script: |
      if (context.issue.number) {
        // Return issue number if present
        return context.issue.number;
      } else {
        // Otherwise return issue number from commit
        return (
          await github.rest.repos.listPullRequestsAssociatedWithCommit({
            commit_sha: context.sha,
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
          })
        ).data[0].number;
      }
    result-encoding: string
```

After that we need to add a new env variable to the step "Lightdash CLI start preview" which is the schema that dbt cloud will use.

Note that in this example we assume the job id is `1234`. You will need to replace this with the actual job id.

```yaml
env:
  # ... keep existing env variables
  DBT_SCHEMA: 'dbt_cloud_pr_1234_${{steps.pr_id.outputs.result}}'
```

Now dbt will use the correct schema when running in the preview environment.

## Automatically deploy your changes to Lightdash using a GitHub action

If you've connected Lightdash to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Lightdash to deploy your project automatically. This is the easiest way to keep Lightdash in sync with your changes in dbt.

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets

We are going to add some credentials to GitHub actions, but you don't want those to be public, so the best way to do this is to add them as action secrets.


<Info>
If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action.
</Info>

Go to your repo, click on `Settings` , on the left sidebar, click on `Secrets` under `Security`. Now click on the `New repository secret`

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/cli/github-secrets-fc35152c7ebb768974b385a0e2601dc5.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

We need to add the following secrets:

##### `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`

Create a new personal access token, by going to `Settings` \> `Personal Access Tokens`. This is the token you'll put in for `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/cli/personal-access-token-9ed8a8c2b16edc5ee745c4909d4093d3.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>


##### `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`

The UUID for your project. For example, if your URL looks like `https://eu1.lightdash.cloud/projects/3538ab33-dc90-aabb-bc00-e50bba3a5f69/tables`, then `3538ab33-dc90-45f0-aabb-e50bba3a5f69` is your `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`

##### `LIGHTDASH_URL`

This is either `https://eu1.lightdash.cloud` or `https://app.lightdash.cloud` for Lightdash Cloud users (check the URL to your Lightdash project). If you self-host, this should be your own custom domain.

##### `DBT_PROFILES`

Some tips for this bit:

* You might be able to copy a bunch of the information from your local `profiles.yml` file. You can see what's in there by typing `cat ~/.dbt/profiles.yml` in your terminal.
* If you have a separate `prod` and `dev` profile, you probably want to use the information from your `prod` profile for your GitHub action.

If you want your preview projects to have different connection settings depending on the user that opened the pull request (dev profiles), then see what you need to add to your secret [in this guide](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview#how-to-use-the-developer-credentials-in-your-preview-project).

### Step 2: Create deploy.yml workflow in Github

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu.

If you don't have any GitHub actions, you'll just need to click on `Configure`

If you have some GitHub actions in your repo already, click on `New workflow`, then select `setup a workflow yourself`.

Now copy [this file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/deploy.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions) repo.

Give it a nice name like `deploy-lightdash.yml`

And commit this to your repo by clicking on `Start commit`.

### You're done!

Everytime you merge a change to your repo, on the `main` branch, it will automatically deploy your new config into your Lightdash projects

You can see the log on the `Github actions` page
