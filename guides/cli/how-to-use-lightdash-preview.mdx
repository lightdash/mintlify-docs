Preview projects will copy all spaces/charts/dashboards into your new preview project, so you can test the content and also run [validation](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-validate). This is only copied on preview creation, you can't sync the content afterwards.

### Run `lightdash preview` from inside your project[](#run-lightdash-preview-from-inside-your-project "Direct link to run-lightdash-preview-from-inside-your-project")

```bash
# This will create a preview and will wait until you press a key to delete the preview project
lightdash preview
```

or

```bash
# This will create a preview and exit, you will have to run lightdash stop-preview to delete it
lightdash start-preview
```

Then `cmd` + `click` to open the preview link from your terminal. Once you're in Lightdash go to `Explore` --> `Tables`, then click on the model(s) you just updated to see your changes and play around with them.

**Problems with credentials?**

When you create preview projects, Lightdash will use the same warehouse connection settings you have in your`profiles.yml` file for your current dbt project. This can be a problem if you're using a local database that your laptop can reach but your Lightdash instance cannot.

## Set up developer previews on your pull requests[](#set-up-developer-previews-on-your-pull-requests "Direct link to Set up developer previews on your pull requests")

If you've connected Lightdash to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Lightdash to create new dynamic `preview` projects automatically when a new `pull request` is created, and it will automatically delete the `preview` project when the `pull request` is closed or merged.

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets[](#step-1-add-the-credentials-to-github-secrets "Direct link to Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets")

If you haven't already set up a GitHub action for Lightdash, you'll need to add some secrets to GitHub. If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action.

We are going to add some secrets and config to GitHub actions, but you don't want those to be public, so the best way to do this is to add them as secrets on Github.

<Info>
  If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action.
</Info>

Go to your repo, click on `Settings` , on the left sidebar, click on `Secrets` under `Security`. Now click on the `New repository secret`

  <img src="/images/guides/cli/github-secrets-fc35152c7ebb768974b385a0e2601dc5.jpg" alt="" />
</Frame>

We need to add the following secrets:

\###$ `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`[](#lightdash%5Fapi%5Fkey "Direct link to lightdash_api_key")

Create a new personal access token, by going to `Settings` > `Personal Access Tokens`. This is the token you'll put in for `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/cli/personal-access-token-9ed8a8c2b16edc5ee745c4909d4093d3.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

##### `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`[](#lightdash%5Fproject "Direct link to lightdash_project")

The UUID for your project. For example, if your URL looks like [`https://eu1.lightdash.cloud/projects/3538ab33-dc90-aabb-bc00-e50bba3a5f69/tables`](https://eu1.lightdash.cloud/projects/3538ab33-dc90-aabb-bc00-e50bba3a5f69/tables), then `3538ab33-dc90-45f0-aabb-e50bba3a5f69` is your `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`

##### `LIGHTDASH_URL`[](#lightdash%5Furl "Direct link to lightdash_url")

This is either [`https://eu1.lightdash.cloud`](https://eu1.lightdash.cloud) or [`https://app.lightdash.cloud`](https://app.lightdash.cloud) for Lightdash Cloud users (check the URL to your Lightdash project). If you self-host, this should be your own custom domain.

##### `DBT_PROFILES`[](#dbt%5Fprofiles "Direct link to dbt_profiles")

Some tips for this bit:

* You might be able to copy a bunch of the information from your local `profiles.yml` file. You can see what's in there by typing `cat ~/.dbt/profiles.yml` in your terminal.

* If you have a separate `prod` and `dev` profile, you probably want to use the information from your `prod` profile for your GitHub action.

* If you want to have different connection settings depending on the user that opened the pull request (dev profiles), then [check out this guide](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview#how-to-use-the-developer-credentials-in-your-preview-project).

Find your data warehouse from the list below to get a profiles.yml file template. Fill out this template, and this is your `DBT_PROFILES` secret.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="BigQuery">
    BigQuery OAuth:

    Step 1: create a secret called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

    Add the service account credentials (the JSON file) that you want to use for your GitHub action. It should look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "jaffle_shop",
      "private_key_id": "12345",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ... -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": "jaffle_shop@jaffle_shop.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "client_id": "12345",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",

      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/jaffle_shop"
    }
    ```

    Step 2: create another secret called `DBT_PROFILES`

    Copy-paste this template into the secret and fill out the details.

### Step 2: Create start-preview.yml and close-preview.yml workflows in Github[](#step-2-create-start-previewyml-and-close-previewyml-workflows-in-github "Direct link to Step 2: Create start-preview.yml and close-preview.yml workflows in Github")

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu, and click on `Configure`

![Github actions page](/images/guides/cli/github-actions-f74f88aa1b1413a111be7dbf16d65d53.png)

Now copy [this start-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/start-preview.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions) repo

And save by clicking on `Start commit`

Do the same with [this close-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/close-preview.yml).

### You're done![](#youre-done "Direct link to You're done!")

Everytime you create a new `pull request` , a new `preview` project with your `branch` name will be created on your organization. Everytime you make a change to that branch, the preview environment will get updated. Once you close or merge your `pull request`, the `preview` project will get deleted.

You can see the log on `Github actions` page

## How to use the developer credentials in your preview project[](#how-to-use-the-developer-credentials-in-your-preview-project "Direct link to How to use the developer credentials in your preview project")

When developing in dbt, you typically have a different set of credentials and dataset/schema than when you are running in production. Here are two options on how to set them up based on the developer that opened the Pull Request.

<Info>
  If you use dbt cloud IDE to create commits and pull requests you need a few extra steps. We need to add a step in the GitHub action to fetch the user that created the pull request.

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/github-script@v6
    id: get_pr_creator
    with:
      script: |
        return (
          await github.rest.repos.listPullRequestsAssociatedWithCommit({
            commit_sha: context.sha,
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
          })
        ).data[0].user.login;
      result-encoding: string

  ```

  When copying the following templates, you should replace `${{ github.actor }}` with `${{steps.get_pr_creator.outputs.result}}`.
</Info>

### Using profile targets[](#using-profile-targets "Direct link to Using profile targets")

Update your `DBT_PROFILES` to have 1 target per developer. The target name should be their GitHub username.

```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: prod
  outputs:
    prod:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: prod
    katie: # example developer 1, should be GitHub username
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_katie
    jose: # example developer 2
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_jose
```

Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the `--target` flag for the `lightdash start-preview` command.

```yaml
run: lightdash start-preview --project-dir "$PROJECT_DIR" --profiles-dir . --name ${GITHUB_REF##*/} --target ${{ github.actor }}
```

### Using github environments[](#using-github-environments "Direct link to Using github environments")

Setup a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) for each developer where the secrets are specifically for them. The environment name should be their GitHub username. Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the environment.

```yaml
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ github.actor }}
```

## How to use the dbt cloud schema in your preview project[](#how-to-use-the-dbt-cloud-schema-in-your-preview-project "Direct link to How to use the dbt cloud schema in your preview project")

If you are using a [continuous integration job in dbt cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs), you can use the schema that is created by dbt cloud (`dbt_cloud_pr_<job_id>_<pr_id>`) for your preview project.

First we need to add an environment variable to your profile.yml file that will be used by dbt to connect to the correct schema.

```yaml
schema: "{{ env_var('DBT_SCHEMA') }}"
```

If you are using BigQuery, it should be `dataset` instead of `schema`.

Then we need to add a step in the GitHub action to fetch the pull request id.

```yaml
- uses: actions/github-script@v6
  id: pr_id
  with:
    script: |
      if (context.issue.number) {
        // Return issue number if present
        return context.issue.number;
      } else {
        // Otherwise return issue number from commit
        return (
          await github.rest.repos.listPullRequestsAssociatedWithCommit({
            commit_sha: context.sha,
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
          })
        ).data[0].number;
      }
    result-encoding: string
```

After that we need to add a new env variable to the step "Lightdash CLI start preview" which is the schema that dbt cloud will use.

Note that in this example we assume the job id is `1234`. You will need to replace this with the actual job id.

```yaml
env:
  # ... keep existing env variables
  DBT_SCHEMA: 'dbt_cloud_pr_1234_${{steps.pr_id.outputs.result}}'
```

Now dbt will use the correct schema when running in the preview environment.
