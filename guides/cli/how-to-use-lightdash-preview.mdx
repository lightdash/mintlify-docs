Preview projects will copy all spaces/charts/dashboards into your new preview project, so you can test the content and also run [validation](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-validate). This is only copied on preview creation, you can't sync the content afterwards.

### Run `lightdash preview` from inside your project

```bash
# This will create a preview and will wait until you press a key to delete the preview project
lightdash preview
```

or

```bash
# This will create a preview and exit, you will have to run lightdash stop-preview to delete it
lightdash start-preview
```

Then `cmd` + `click` to open the preview link from your terminal. Once you're in Lightdash go to `Explore` --> `Tables`, then click on the model(s) you just updated to see your changes and play around with them.

<Info>
**Problems with credentials?**

  When you create preview projects, Lightdash will use the same warehouse connection settings you have in your `profiles.yml` file for your current dbt project. This can be a problem if you're using a local database that your laptop can reach but your Lightdash instance cannot.
