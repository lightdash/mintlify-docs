Here's an example of a percent of the total group/pivot:

And here's the SQL used in the table calculation:

```bash
${orders.total_order_amount} /
  SUM(${orders.total_order_amount}) OVER (
    PARTITION BY
      ${orders.status}
  )

```

In general, the SQL used for calculating the percent of the total has two important columns:

* `column_i_want_to_see_the_percent_of_total` \- this is the column that you want to see the percent total of. In our example above, that was the `sum of profit`.
* `column_i_want_to_group_by` \- this is the column that you want the total to be grouped by. In our example above, that was the `order date - week`.

### Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate the percent of the group/pivot total[](#heres-the-sql-you-can-copy-paste-to-calculate-the-percent-of-the-grouppivot-total "Direct link to Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate the percent of the group/pivot total")

```bash
${table.column_i_want_to_see_the_percent_of_total} /
  SUM(${table.column_i_want_to_see_the_percent_of_total}) OVER (
    PARTITION BY
      ${table.column_i_want_to_group_by}
  )

```

### Make sure to add percent formatting to your calculation[](#make-sure-to-add-percent-formatting-to-your-calculation "Direct link to Make sure to add percent formatting to your calculation")

In the `format` tab, make sure to update the format to `percent` so that your table calculation is shown as a percentage value (instead of a number).
