Here's an example of a percent of the total column:

And here's the SQL used in the table calculation:

```
${orders.total_order_amount} / SUM(${orders.total_order_amount}) OVER()

```

In general, the SQL used for calculating the percent of the total has just one important column:

* `column_i_want_to_see_the_percent_of_total` \- this is the column that you want to see each value's percent of the total values in that column

### Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate the percent of the column total[](#heres-the-sql-you-can-copy-paste-to-calculate-the-percent-of-the-column-total "Direct link to Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate the percent of the column total")

```bash
${table.column_i_want_to_see_the_percent_of_total} /
  SUM(${table.column_i_want_to_see_the_percent_of_total}) OVER()

```

### Make sure to add percent formatting to your calculation[](#make-sure-to-add-percent-formatting-to-your-calculation "Direct link to Make sure to add percent formatting to your calculation")

In the `format` tab, make sure to update the format to `percent` so that your table calculation is shown as a percentage value (instead of a number).
