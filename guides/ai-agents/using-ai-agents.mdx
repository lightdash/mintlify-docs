## Core capabilities

AI agents in Lightdash allow you to:

- **Ask questions in natural language** - Simply type what you want to know about your data, like "What's our total revenue by region?" or "Show me user growth over the last 6 months"
- **Get instant visualizations** - Receive bar charts, time series, and tables automatically generated based on your questions
- **Explore interactively** - Follow up with additional questions, drill down into specific data points, or request different chart types
- **Maintain conversation context** - AI agents remember your conversation history, so you can build on previous questions and refine your analysis
- **Provide text-only responses** - Get answers in natural language when visualizations aren't needed
- **Guide you to the right data** - Direct you to the most relevant explores or tables for your questions
- **Discover existing content** - Find and share relevant charts and dashboards that have already been created in your project
- **Generate complete dashboards** - Create multiple related visualizations at once that tell a cohesive story about your data, perfect for executive summaries or thematic analyses

As mentioned earlier, Lightdash agents use the **semantic layer** defined in your dbt models to understand your data structure, relationships, and business logic.
This ensures that the AI generates accurate queries and visualizations based on your specific data context.
So, *when an Agent generates an answer, the output is a semantic query, **not SQL!*** This means that you can easily swap between the conversational AI interface and the standard Lightdash exploration experience.

## FAQs

1. Does Lightdash store the query data?

Lightdash only stores simple one-line answers so you can look back at your conversation history. We also save the basic query info to recreate these when needed. The actual data and detailed results stays in your warehouse and gets pulled fresh when the results are revisited (unless data access is enabled).

2. Can I assign a default agent?

You can assign your default agent in Ask AI by clicking the star by your agent's name.
