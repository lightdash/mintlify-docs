Create custom evaluation suites to batch test your agent's performance and ensure consistent, high-quality responses across different scenarios.

## How evaluations work

1. **Define evaluation questions** - Build a set of test questions for each agent. You can either:
   - Manually create questions that represent common use cases
   - Select responses from existing agent conversations in the admin page to add to your evaluation set

       </Frame>
     </Accordion>
2. **Run batch tests** - Execute all prompts in your evaluation set against the agent to see how it responds

3. **Review results** - Manually review the agent's responses to ensure they meet your quality standards and expectations

## Using feedback to improve evaluations

Encourage your team to actively use the thumbs-up/thumbs-down feature when interacting with AI agents. This feedback helps admins in two key ways:

- **Identify improvement areas** - Thumbs-down responses highlight where the agent needs work
- **Build better evaluation sets** - Filter and easily add thumbs-down responses to your evaluation suite to test fixes and prevent regressions

This systematic testing approach helps you:

- Verify agent performance before deploying changes
- Ensure consistency across common queries
