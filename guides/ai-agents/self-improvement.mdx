title: Self-improvement (Beta)
description: Enable AI agents to improve your semantic layer automatically
---

<Warning>
  This feature is currently in Beta. Enable it in your agent settings to start
  testing with your team.
</Warning>

AI agents can now improve your semantic layer by proposing changes to your data models. When enabled, agents can update field descriptions, create new metrics, and refine your data documentation based on conversations and user feedback. All changes are tracked in changesets and can be reviewed or reverted at any time.

## How it works

When self-improvement is enabled, your AI agent can:

1. **Propose changes** to your semantic layer during conversations
2. **Apply changes immediately** to a changeset (batch of changes)
3. **Track all modifications** with full history and attribution
4. **Allow review and rejection** of changes by authorized users

Changes are visible in the chat interface and can be managed through the Project Settings > Changesets page.
