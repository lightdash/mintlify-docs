title: Best practices for AI agents
description: Learn how to configure and optimize your AI agents for the best results
---

To get the most accurate and useful answers from your AI agents, follow these best practices for preparing your data and configuring your agents.

## Think specialized, not general

Think of AI agents as your specialized analysts - each one can be configured to focus on specific areas of your business. For example, you might create a "Marketing Assistant" that only has access to marketing data like campaign performance, lead generation, and customer acquisition metrics. This focused approach ensures more accurate, relevant responses and prevents sensitive data from being accessible to the wrong teams. To find out more about how to configure specific access, see [Limiting access to specific explores/fields](/guides/ai-agents/getting-started#limiting-access-to-specific-explores-and-fields).

## Document your data thoroughly

Good documentation is crucial for AI to understand your data models and provide meaningful insights. The quality of the results depend on the quality of your metadata and documentation.

- **Write clear, descriptive names** for metrics and dimensions
- **Add detailed descriptions** to all metrics and dimensions explaining what they represent
- **Include example questions** in descriptions that AI could answer with the metric
- **Use AI hints** to provide additional context specifically for AI agents

Remember: If your colleague wouldn't understand your documentation, neither will the AI agent. The more context you provide, the better the AI can interpret and analyze your data.

## Using AI hints

AI hints are specialized metadata fields that provide additional context specifically for AI agents. These hints help the AI better understand your data models, business logic, and how to interpret your metrics and dimensions.

<Info>
  AI hints are internal metadata used only by AI agents and are not displayed to
  users in the Lightdash interface. When both AI hints and descriptions are
  present, AI hints take precedence for AI agent prompts.
</Info>

AI hints support both string and array of strings formats. The array format allows you to organize multiple distinct pieces of information as separate hints, making them easier to read and maintain.

You can add AI hints at three levels:

### Model-level hints

Provide context about the entire table:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
models:
  - name: customers
    config:
      meta:
        ai_hint:
          - This is a customers table containing customer information and derived facts
          - Use this for customer demographics, behavior analysis, and segmentation
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
models:
  - name: customers
    meta:
      ai_hint:
        - This is a customers table containing customer information and derived facts
        - Use this for customer demographics, behavior analysis, and segmentation
```

</CodeGroup>

String format:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
models:
  - name: customers
    config:
      meta:
        ai_hint: |
          This is a customers table containing customer information and derived facts.
          Use this for customer demographics, behavior analysis, and segmentation.
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
models:
  - name: customers
    meta:
      ai_hint: |
        This is a customers table containing customer information and derived facts.
        Use this for customer demographics, behavior analysis, and segmentation.
```

</CodeGroup>

### Dimension-level hints

Explain individual columns:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
columns:
  - name: last_name
    config:
      meta:
        dimension:
          ai_hint:
            - Customer's last name
            - Contains PII data - use for identification but be mindful of privacy
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
columns:
  - name: last_name
    meta:
      dimension:
        ai_hint:
          - Customer's last name
          - Contains PII data - use for identification but be mindful of privacy
```

</CodeGroup>

### Metric-level hints

Clarify what metrics measure:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
columns:
  - name: customer_id
    config:
      meta:
        metrics:
          unique_customer_count:
            type: count_distinct
            ai_hint:
              - Unique customer count for business reporting
              - Use this for customer acquisition and retention analysis
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
columns:
  - name: customer_id
    meta:
      metrics:
        unique_customer_count:
          type: count_distinct
          ai_hint:
            - Unique customer count for business reporting
            - Use this for customer acquisition and retention analysis
```

</CodeGroup>

## Writing effective instructions

Think of your instructions as teaching your AI agent about your world. The better you explain your business context and preferences, the more useful and relevant your agent's responses will be.

Focus on four key areas: what your agent should know about your industry, your team's goals and constraints, how you like data analyzed, and how results should be communicated.

### What to include

- **Industry terminology and key metrics** including acronyms your team uses regularly (e.g., "CPM means Cost Per Mille, not cost per mile" or "Our ARR calculations exclude one-time setup fees")
- **Communication style** for how results should be presented to your team (e.g., "Keep explanations simple for non-technical stakeholders" or "Always include actionable next steps")
- **Business constraints** like regulatory requirements or budget limitations that affect decision-making
- **Analysis preferences** your team relies on (e.g., "Always compare month-over-month growth" or "Flag any churn rates above 5% as concerning")
- **Context for interpreting your data** (e.g., "Our Q4 always shows higher sales due to holiday promotions" or "Weekend traffic is typically 40% lower")

<Check>
  **Good example - Sales Team Agent:** <br />
  You analyze sales performance for our SaaS company. Focus on MRR, churn, and pipeline
  health. When MRR growth drops below 10% month-over-month, flag it as concerning.
  Present insights in simple terms that our sales managers can act on immediately.
  Always include trend explanations and next steps.
</Check>

### What to avoid

- **Contradictory instructions** that create confusion about priorities
- **Overly complex rules** that are hard to follow consistently
- **Vague guidance** like "be helpful" without explaining what that means for your situation
- **Too many different focus areas** in one agent, remember to keep each agent focused, there are no limits on the number of agents you can create!
- **Restating basic features**, don't tell the AI to "create charts" since it already does that

<Danger>
  **Poor example - Too vague:** <br />
  Be helpful and analyze data well. Create good charts and explain things clearly.
</Danger>
