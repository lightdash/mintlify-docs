Mark AI-generated charts and dashboards as verified answers to help your agent learn from the best examples and provide better responses to similar questions.

## How verified answers work

1. **Verify high-quality responses** - When your AI agent generates a particularly good chart or dashboard, click the verification icon to mark it as a verified answer. This tells the agent "this is a great example of how to answer this type of question."
