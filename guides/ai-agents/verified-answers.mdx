description: Train your AI agent with high-quality examples for better, more consistent responses
---

Mark AI-generated charts and dashboards as verified answers to help your agent learn from the best examples and provide better responses to similar questions.

## How verified answers work

1. **Verify high-quality responses** - When your AI agent generates a particularly good chart or dashboard, click the verification icon to mark it as a verified answer. This tells the agent "this is a great example of how to answer this type of question."

2. **Agent learns from examples** - Your agent references verified answers when responding to similar questions, leading to more consistent and accurate responses

3. **Suggested questions** - When starting a new conversation, users see suggested questions based on your verified answers, making it easier to discover what the agent can do

4. **Slack integration** - When your [AI agent is integrated into Slack](/guides/ai-agents/getting-started#slack-integration), it automatically references verified answers in its responses. If you ask a question that has already been answered or for which there's already a chart, the agent will include a link to the verified answer in the Slack response

## Managing verified answers

### Verifying an answer

1. In any AI agent conversation, review the generated chart
2. Click the checkmark icon in the top right corner of the chart
3. The answer is now verified and will be used as a reference example

### Viewing all verified answers

Navigate to your agent's settings page and select the **Verified answers** tab to see:

-   All verified charts and dashboards
-   Who verified each answer and when
-   How many times each answer has been referenced by the agent
-   Preview of the visualization

### Removing verification

If an answer is no longer a good example:

1. Go to the **Verified answers** tab in the agent's settings page
2. Find the answer you want to remove
3. Click the remove icon
4. Confirm removal - the answer will no longer be used as a reference

## Best practices

-   **Verify diverse examples** - Mark answers covering different types of questions and use cases to give your agent a broad knowledge base

-   **Quality over quantity** - Focus on verifying only your best, most accurate responses. A few excellent examples are better than many mediocre ones

-   **Update regularly** - As your data and business needs evolve, review your verified answers and update them to reflect current best practices

## Who can verify answers?

Only users with the **Admin** and **Developer** roles can verify answers.

## How this improves your agent

Verified answers help your agent:

-   **Maintain consistency** - Reference proven examples when answering similar questions
-   **Improve accuracy** - Learn from high-quality, verified responses rather than trial and error
-   **Discover patterns** - Understand the types of visualizations and analyses that work best for your data
