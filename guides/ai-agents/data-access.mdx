title: Data access control
description: Understand how AI agents access and use your data
---

AI agents offer flexible data access control to balance insights with privacy and security. By default, agents work with metadata only, but you can optionally enable data access for deeper analysis.

## Data access modes

**Metadata-only mode (default):**

- Agents can see your data structure, field names, and model definitions
- They can generate appropriate queries and visualizations
- No actual data values (except for one-row query results) are shared with the agent
- Perfect for exploring data structure and creating initial analyses

**Data access enabled:**

- Agents receive actual query results in addition to metadata
- Can provide specific insights, identify trends, and analyze patterns in your data
- Offers detailed summaries and data-driven recommendations
- Can search for actual field values to ensure accurate filters when building visualizations
- Only shares data when explicitly enabled per agent

<Info>
  Data access is optional and controlled per agent. When disabled, agents only
  work with your data model structure and cannot see actual data values. This
  ensures sensitive information is only shared when you explicitly choose to
  enable this capability.

## User attributes and permissions

<Info>
AI Agents in the Lightdash app will follow row-level, column-level, and table-level data access based on [user attributes](/references/user-attributes).

In Slack, the AI will have the user attributes of the user who set up the agent. We plan to respect user attributes based on Slack user email in the future, reach out if you need that feature!
