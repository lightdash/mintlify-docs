<Info>
  Agent memory can be modified by admins and developers only
</Info>

AI agents can now learn from your corrections and feedback. When you correct an agent's response or guide it to better understand your data, the agent can automatically update its own instructions to remember these preferences for future conversations. The memory will only be saved if you approve the agent's suggested learning.

## How it works

- When an agent makes a mistake or you provide clarification, it can capture this feedback
- The agent updates its instructions field with the new learning
- All future conversations with that agent will benefit from this accumulated knowledge
- Memories are stored directly in the agent's instructions, which you can view and edit in agent settings

## What agents can learn

Agents can learn various types of corrections and preferences:

- **Which tables or explores to use** for specific types of queries
- **Field selection preferences** like "always use net_revenue instead of gross_revenue when generating revenue charts"
- **Filter logic** such as "exclude test accounts when counting customers"
- **Chart type preferences** like "use bar charts for categorical comparisons" or "prefer tables for detailed breakdowns over scatter plots"
- **Complex chart patterns** that require specific guidance, such as period-over-period analysis where you teach the agent what the expected output should look like
- **General preferences** about formatting, ordering, or analysis approaches
