Getting started with AI agents is simple - you can begin using them right away on any project in your Lightdash instance.

1. **Go to "Ask AI"** in your project
2. **Create a new agent**
3. **Configure your agent**

## Configure your agent
### Name and image
Give your agent a memorable name and visual identity
### Instructions
Provide context to guide your agent’s reasoning and ensure responses match your expectations. Your instructions can include any of the following components. Each one helps the agent understand your data, your business, and how you want insights delivered:

- Domain knowledge
Describe the industry or subject area the AI should think within. Include relevant terminology, methodologies, frameworks, and technical concepts.

- Company context
Explain the business background behind your analysis. Add details about your goals, product, target audience, strategy, or any constraints that influence how insights should be generated.

- Analysis preferences
Clarify how you want the AI to approach analysis. Specify preferred metrics, dimensions, chart types, visualization styles, and reporting formats so results match your expectations.

- Role & expertise
Tell the AI what role it should adopt (e.g., “Senior Analytics Engineer”). Include the communication style, depth of explanation, and level of decision-making authority you expect.

The more context you provide, the more accurate, relevant, and predictable your agent’s responses will be.

### Enable Data Access (optional)
Enable data access to allow your agent to analyze actual query results and provide insights based on the data. When disabled, agents work with metadata only
### Enable Self-Improvement (optional, Beta)
Allow your agent to propose changes to your semantic layer, including updating descriptions and creating new metrics. Changes are tracked in changesets for review
   - **User and Group Access (optional)** - Control which users and groups can access your agent through the agent settings
   - **Tags (optional)** - Use dbt tags to control which metrics and dimensions the agent can access
   - **Slack Integration (optional)** - Connect your agent to Slack channels so users can interact directly from Slack

Once set up, you can start asking questions immediately! Try asking "What kind of data can you access?" to get started.

## Setting up multiple agents

You can create multiple AI agents, each configured for different tasks, tones, languages, or teams. Each agent can have access to different datasets to focus results and give more accurate answers.

## Limiting access to specific explores and fields

You can control which explores and fields your AI agent can access using tags from your dbt models. When you configure tags in your agent settings, the agent will only see explores and fields that have matching tags.

**How tag matching works:**
- Add one or more tags to your agent settings
- Fields or explores with **any** of those tags will be accessible to the agent
- If no tags are configured, the agent can access everything
- As you add tags, you can interactively explore which explores and fields will be available in the agent settings interface

  <img
    src="/images/guides/ai-agents/agent-tags-preview.gif"
    alt="Interactive preview of explores and fields filtered by tags in agent settings"
  />
</Frame>

**Two levels of tagging:**
1. **Explore-level tags** - Tag the model to control access to entire explores
2. **Field-level tags** - Tag individual metrics and dimensions for granular control

### How filtering works

The filtering behavior depends on how you've tagged your models:

**Explore visibility:**
- An explore is only visible if its **base table** has matching tags at either:
  - Explore level (model tags match agent tags), OR
  - Field level (at least one base table field has matching tags)
- If only joined tables have matching tags but the base table doesn't, the explore will be hidden

**Field visibility per table:**

Each table in an explore is filtered independently using one of two modes:

1. **Field-level mode** (when ANY field in the table has tags defined):
   - Only fields with matching tags are visible
   - Other fields are hidden, even if the explore is tagged
   - Note: An empty tags array (`tags: []`) activates field-level mode but matches nothing

2. **Explore-level mode** (when NO fields in the table have tags):
   - If explore tags match: ALL fields in the table are visible
   - If explore tags don't match: NO fields are visible

### Adding tags at the model level

Tag entire models to give your AI agent access to all metrics and dimensions within that explore:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
models:
  - name: marketing_campaigns
    config:
      meta:
        tags: ["marketing", "ai"] #    <--------- tagging the entire model
    columns:
      - name: campaign_name
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              type: string
      - name: impressions
        config:
          meta:
            metrics:
              total_impressions:
                type: sum
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
models:
  - name: marketing_campaigns
    meta:
      tags: ["marketing", "ai"] #    <--------- tagging the entire model
    columns:
      - name: campaign_name
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
      - name: impressions
        meta:
          metrics:
            total_impressions:
              type: sum
```

</CodeGroup>

### Adding tags to individual metrics & dimensions

For more granular control, tag specific metrics and dimensions:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: status
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai", "sales"] # <--------- tagging the dimension
      - name: location
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai", "operations"] # <--------- tagging the dimension
      - name: amount
        description: Total amount of the order
        config:
          meta:
            metrics:
              total_order_amount:
                type: sum
                format: usd
                round: 2
                tags: ["ai", "finance"] # <--------- tagging the metric
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
- name: orders
  columns:
    - name: status
      meta:
        dimension:
          tags: ['ai', 'sales'] #    <--------- tagging the dimension
     - name: location
      meta:
        dimension:
          tags: ['ai', 'operations'] #    <--------- tagging the dimension
    - name: amount
      description: Total amount of the order
      meta:
        metrics:
          total_order_amount:
            type: sum
            format: usd
            round: 2
            tags: ['ai', 'finance'] #    <--------- tagging the metric
```

</CodeGroup>

### Common scenarios

Here are some common tagging scenarios and their results:

**Scenario 1: Explore-level only (no field tags)**
```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    config:
      meta:
        tags: ["ai-enabled"]
    columns:
      - name: customer_name
      - name: email
```
Result: If agent has `["ai-enabled"]` tag, ALL fields in the customers explore are visible.

**Scenario 2: Field-level only (no explore tags)**
```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_name
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai-enabled"]
      - name: email
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["pii"]
```
Result: If agent has `["ai-enabled"]` tag, only `customer_name` is visible. The `email` field is hidden.

**Scenario 3: Mixed - explore tagged with fields that have different tags**
```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    config:
      meta:
        tags: ["ai-enabled"]
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["pii"]
      - name: status
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["internal"]
```
Result: If agent has `["ai-enabled"]` tag, NO fields are visible. Field-level mode is active (because fields have tags), and none of the field tags match "ai-enabled".

**Scenario 4: Mixed mode - base model with explore tags, joined model with field tags**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="orders.yml (base model)">
```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    config:
      meta:
        tags: ["ai-enabled"]
        joins:
          - join: customers
            sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
    columns:
      - name: order_id
      - name: status
      - name: customer_id
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="customers.yml (joined model)">
```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
      - name: email
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai-enabled"]
      - name: phone
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["pii"]
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Result: If agent has `["ai-enabled"]` tag:
- `orders` table: ALL fields visible (explore-level mode - no field tags defined)
- `customers` table: Only `email` visible (field-level mode - has field tags, only `email` matches)

**Scenario 5: Only joined table has matching tags**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="orders.yml (base model)">
```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    config:
      meta:
        joins:
          - join: customers
            sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
    columns:
      - name: order_id # no tags
      - name: status # no tags
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="customers.yml (joined model)">
```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: email
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai-enabled"]
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Result: The entire explore is HIDDEN because the base table (`orders`) has no matching tags.

<Warning>
  An explore is only visible if the **base table** has matching tags (either at explore level or field level). Having matching tags only in joined tables is not enough.
</Warning>
