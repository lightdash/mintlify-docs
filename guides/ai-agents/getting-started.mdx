Getting started with AI agents is simple - you can begin using them right away on any project in your Lightdash instance.

## Creating your first AI agent

1. **Find the "Ask AI" button** in your project - this will be your entry point to AI agents
2. **Create a new agent** (only admins and developers can create new AI agents)
3. **Configure your agent:**

   - **Name and image** - Give your agent a memorable name and visual identity
   - **Instructions (optional)** - Provide context about your models, tables, or specific use cases to help the AI give more relevant responses. Some templates are provided to get you started.
   - **Enable Data Access (optional)** - Enable data access to allow your agent to analyze actual query results and provide insights based on the data. When disabled, agents work with metadata only
   - **Enable Self-Improvement (optional, Beta)** - Allow your agent to propose changes to your semantic layer, including updating descriptions and creating new metrics. Changes are tracked in changesets for review
   - **User and Group Access (optional)** - Control which users and groups can access your agent through the agent settings
   - **Tags (optional)** - Use dbt tags to control which metrics and dimensions the agent can access
   - **Slack Integration (optional)** - Connect your agent to Slack channels so users can interact directly from Slack

Once set up, you can start asking questions immediately! Try asking "What kind of data can you access?" to get started.

## Setting up multiple agents

You can create multiple AI agents, each configured for different tasks, tones, languages, or teams. Each agent can have access to different datasets to focus results and give more accurate answers.

## Limiting access to specific explores and fields

For each AI agent, you can configure which fields are used to answer questions using the tags you've defined in your YAML files. You can add one or many tags - fields with **any** of the tags in the list will be considered by the AI agent.

Use tags to control which metrics and dimensions each AI agent can access. This helps focus the AI on the most relevant data for analysis and ensures agents only work with appropriate datasets. You can add tags at the model level to give access to entire explores, or at the individual metric and dimension level for more granular control.

### Adding tags at the model level

Tag entire models to give your AI agent access to all metrics and dimensions within that explore:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
models:
  - name: marketing_campaigns
    config:
      meta:
        tags: ["marketing", "ai"] #    <--------- tagging the entire model
    columns:
      - name: campaign_name
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              type: string
      - name: impressions
        config:
          meta:
            metrics:
              total_impressions:
                type: sum
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
models:
  - name: marketing_campaigns
    meta:
      tags: ["marketing", "ai"] #    <--------- tagging the entire model
    columns:
      - name: campaign_name
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
      - name: impressions
        meta:
          metrics:
            total_impressions:
              type: sum
```

</CodeGroup>

### Adding tags to individual metrics & dimensions

For more granular control, tag specific metrics and dimensions:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: status
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai", "sales"] # <--------- tagging the dimension
      - name: location
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai", "operations"] # <--------- tagging the dimension
      - name: amount
        description: Total amount of the order
        config:
          meta:
            metrics:
              total_order_amount:
                type: sum
                format: usd
                round: 2
                tags: ["ai", "finance"] # <--------- tagging the metric
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
- name: orders
  columns:
    - name: status
      meta:
        dimension:
          tags: ['ai', 'sales'] #    <--------- tagging the dimension
     - name: location
      meta:
        dimension:
          tags: ['ai', 'operations'] #    <--------- tagging the dimension
    - name: amount
      description: Total amount of the order
      meta:
        metrics:
          total_order_amount:
            type: sum
            format: usd
            round: 2
            tags: ['ai', 'finance'] #    <--------- tagging the metric
```

</CodeGroup>
