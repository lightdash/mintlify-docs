## Configure your agent

### Name and image
Give your agent a memorable name and visual identity
### Instructions
Provide context to guide your agent’s reasoning and ensure responses match your expectations. Your instructions can include any of the following components. Each one helps the agent understand your data, your business, and how you want insights delivered:

- **Domain knowledge** - 
Describe the industry or subject area the AI should think within. Include relevant terminology, methodologies, frameworks, and technical concepts.

- **Company context** - 
Explain the business background behind your analysis. Add details about your goals, product, target audience, strategy, or any constraints that influence how insights should be generated.

- **Analysis preferences** -
Clarify how you want the AI to approach analysis. Specify preferred metrics, dimensions, chart types, visualization styles, and reporting formats so results match your expectations.

- **Role & expertise** - 
Tell the AI what role it should adopt (e.g., “Senior Marketing Analyst”). Include the communication style, depth of explanation, and level of decision-making authority you expect.

The more context you provide, the more accurate, relevant, and predictable your agent’s responses will be.

### Enable Data Access (optional)
Enable data access to allow your agent to analyze actual query results and provide insights based on the data. When disabled, agents work with metadata only. Learn [how to enable data access](/guides/ai-agents/data-access#how-to-enable-data-access)
### User and Group Access (optional)
Control which users and groups can access your agent through the agent settings. For detailed guidance on how to configure data access control, see [here](/guides/ai-agents/data-access#user-attributes-and-permissions)
### Tags (optional)
Use tags in the Lightdash metadata to control which metrics and dimensions the agent can access. Tags help you restrict your agent to a specific slice of your semantic layer.

1. Tag your dbt model dimensions and metrics with the tags you want - your agent will only have access to those dimensions or metrics that have matching tags.

<Accordion title="View code examples">
<CodeGroup>

```yaml dbt 1.10+
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: status
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai", "sales"] # <--------- tagging the dimension
      - name: location
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              tags: ["ai", "operations"] # <--------- tagging the dimension
      - name: amount
        description: Total amount of the order
        config:
          meta:
            metrics:
              total_order_amount:
                type: sum
                format: usd
                round: 2
                tags: ["ai", "finance"] # <--------- tagging the metric
```

```yaml dbt <=1.9
- name: orders
  columns:
    - name: status
      meta:
        dimension:
          tags: ['ai', 'sales'] #    <--------- tagging the dimension
     - name: location
      meta:
        dimension:
          tags: ['ai', 'operations'] #    <--------- tagging the dimension
    - name: amount
      description: Total amount of the order
      meta:
        metrics:
          total_order_amount:
            type: sum
            format: usd
            round: 2
            tags: ['ai', 'finance'] #    <--------- tagging the metric
```

</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

2. Add the corresponding tags to your agent settings under the Tags field. This tells the agent which tagged dimensions and metrics it should access.

3. For more technical users who want to configure tagging rules in more detail - including how tags interact with permissions and schema visibility - see the [Data access control section.](/guides/ai-agents/data-access#limiting-access-to-specific-explores-and-fields)

### Enable Self-Improvement (optional, Beta)
Allow your agent to propose changes to your semantic layer, including updating descriptions and creating new metrics. Changes are tracked in changesets for review. Read more on [self-improvement (beta)](/guides/ai-agents/self-improvement) feature.

## Slack Integration
Connect your agent to Slack channels so users can interact directly from Slack. Check out all the cool ways to integrate your agent into slack [here](/guides/using-slack-integration#using-the-slack-integration)
1. Add Slack to your organization in organization settings. An admin needs to complete this step. See the [how-to guide](/references/workspace/adding-slack-integration).
2. Add the desired slack channel to your agent integration settings.

  <img src="/images/guides/ai-agents/ai-integrations.png" />

3. Add the `Lightdash for analytics` app to your desired slack channel by going to ***#channel*** --> ***Edit settings*** --> ***Integrations***:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/ai-agents/add-lightdash-app-to-slack.png" />
</Frame>

4. Now you can interact with your AI agent in slack just as you would in the Lightdash UI. Start asking questions like "What kind of data can you access?" or "Show me total order amount over time".

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guides/ai-agents/use-agent-in-slack.png" />
</Frame>

5. You can also summon the bot on a thread to continue the conversation. In order for the bot to be able to respond, you need to enable this context sharing in your Lightdash Integrations settings.

<br />
Once you're set up - whether in the UI or in Slack - you can start asking questions immediately! Try asking "What kind of data can you access?" to get started:

</Frame>

## Setting up multiple agents

You can create multiple AI agents, each configured for different tasks, tones, languages, or teams. Each agent can have access to different datasets to focus results and give more accurate answers.

### Slack channel limitations

By default, each AI agent can only be connected to one Slack channel. If you try to configure two agents in the same Slack channel, you'll receive an error.

<Note>
**Multi-agent Slack channels (Beta):** To enable multiple agents in the same Slack channel, contact Lightdash to enable the multi-agent Slack feature flag for your organization.
</Note>

With multi-agent Slack enabled, multiple AI agents can be used in the same Slack channel. When you mention the Lightdash app in Slack, you don't need to specify which agent you want to talk to - there's only one Lightdash Slack app name to mention. Lightdash automatically routes your question to the most appropriate agent based on your question. If it's unclear which agent should respond, you'll be prompted to choose which agent you'd like to answer.
