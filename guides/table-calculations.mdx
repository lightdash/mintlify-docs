description: "Table calculations make it easy to create metrics on the fly (for example, aggregating the data in your table over some window, or getting a running total of a column)."

You add table calculations in the Explore view and they appear as green columns in your results table (remember, [dimensions](/references/dimensions) are blue, and [metrics](/references/metrics) are orange).
