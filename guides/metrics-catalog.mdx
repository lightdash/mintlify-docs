title: "Spotlight"
description: Spotlight is a suite of features designed to put Metrics front and center. It simplifies data exploration, making it easy for business users to focus on metrics without dealing with complex tables or time dimensions.
---

<Info>
  **The Spotlight features are currently in beta.**

  We're actively testing and improving them — some of the functionality might be subject to change.
</Info>

## Getting Started

Lightdash users don't need to do anything to get started! Spotlight features use your existing [Lightdash semantic layer](/guides/lightdash-semantic-layer) and metrics definitions, so you can get started today.

Head to the Metrics Catalog under the Browse menu in the navigation bar.

## Browsing the catalog

Browse all the project metrics you have access to (based on permissions and user-attributes) in the **Metrics Catalog**.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/guides/metrics-catalog/browsing-the-catalog-a9520c871903cedd96eb7923a1b3ae4e.webp)
</Frame>

1. **Search**: Easily find metrics by their names or .yml descriptions using the searchbar.

2. **View .yml descriptions**: Click on any description to expand and view the full content, including rendered Markdown.

3. **Categories**: Use categories to streamline your metrics and KPIs. Filter metrics by category and add new ones directly in the UI. ***Users with editor permissions and above*** can click on any category cell to edit, rename, change its color, or delete it.

4. **View popularity**: Discover a metric’s popularity and see where it’s being used. Click to explore a complete list of charts which use the metric. Metrics are sorted by default to highlight the most used ones first.

5. **Explore**: ***Interactive viewers and above*** can dive deeper by clicking *Explore* to visualize the metric in a chart format.

## Exploring a metric

Visualize your metrics in the **Metrics Explorer**.

</Frame>

1. **Plot over time**: View your selected metric plotted over a time dimension as a line chart. You can adjust this dimension or set a default time dimension in your `.yml` to simplify the process for users. [See how](#configuring-default-time-settings-in-yml)

2. **Filter by date**: Use the date picker with convenient presets for quick selection. [See how default presets work based on the granularity](#faq)

3. **Adjust the time granularity**: Refine your view by choosing the desired level of date granularity.

4. **Filter by a dimension:** Filter your metric by any string or boolean dimension from the same table.

5. **Segment-by**: Break down the metric by any non-time dimension in your dataset.

6. **Compare to:**

   * **'This time last year'**: Compare the selected time period to the same period last year

   * **'Another metric':** Compare to any other metric in the project **that has a default time dimension specified in the `.yml`**. This includes joins [See how](#configuring-default-time-settings-in-yml)

7. **Drag to zoom:** Click and drag across the chart to highlight the desired time range or data points, then release to zoom in on that segment. Hit ‘Reset Zoom’ to reset chart.

## Curating Spotlight for your business users

Spotlight is designed to be a tool for your business users to explore and understand your data.

To make Spotlight more useful for your business users, you can curate the metrics they can see and explore.

To do this, you can:

* Control the visibility of metrics in the catalog

* Add categories to your metrics

* Add default time settings to your metrics

All through your Lightdash `.yml` files.

### Configuring global visibility of metrics

You can control the visibility of metrics in the catalog by creating a new file called `lightdash.config.yml` in the root of your dbt project.

<Info>
  If you're new to lightdash.config.yml, check out our [getting started guide](/references/lightdash-config-yml#getting-started-with-lightdashconfigyml) to learn how to create and set up this file.
</Info>

See this video for an example on how to set this up:

<div
  style={{
position: "relative",
paddingBottom: "56.25%",
height: "0",
marginBottom: "40px",
}}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/1cedbf73be24445abecde95132284e91?sid=67cf36bd-f81e-40a8-b64e-972bbcfc836a"
    frameborder="0"
    webkitallowfullscreen
    mozallowfullscreen
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
  position: "absolute",
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
  width: "100%",
  height: "100%",
}}
  />
</div>

**Step-by-step guide**

1. Add the following to your `lightdash.config.yml` file:

```yml
spotlight:
  default_visibility: show
```

<Info>
  **The default visibility can be set to `show` or `hide`.**

  If you don't set this, the default visibility will be `show`, so all metrics will be visible in the catalog by default (but other settings like user attributes will still apply).
</Info>

This will set the default visibility of metrics in the catalog to `show` for all metrics in your project. You can also set this to `hide` if you prefer to hide metrics by default and then override this on a per-model/metric basis.

2. Now that you've set the default visibility, you can override this on a per-model/metric basis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        meta:
          spotlight:
            visibility: hide
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        config:
          meta:
            spotlight:
              visibility: hide
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will hide the events model from the catalog.

3. If there are metrics in the events model that you want to make visible, you can override the default visibility for those metrics.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        meta:
          spotlight:
            visibility: hide
          metrics:
            event_count:
              type: count
              spotlight:
                visibility: show
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        config:
          meta:
            spotlight:
              visibility: hide
            metrics:
              event_count:
                type: count
                spotlight:
                  visibility: show
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

4. Once you compile your project, you'll see the `event_count` metric in the catalog, even though the events model is hidden.

### Assigning categories to metrics

Categories are a great way to organize your metrics in the catalog. You can create a new category by adding a new `categories` field to your `lightdash.config.yml` file.

Here's a video showing how to set this up:

<div
  style={{
position: "relative",
paddingBottom: "56.25%",
height: "0",
marginBottom: "40px",
}}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/16690385fac04d97963d0dc36aba5f87?sid=7119a8aa-b4d2-4ba4-859c-0d76a6fe081b"
    frameborder="0"
    webkitallowfullscreen
    mozallowfullscreen
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
  position: "absolute",
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
  width: "100%",
  height: "100%",
}}
  />
</div>

**Step-by-step guide**

1. Add the following to your `lightdash.config.yml` file:

```yml
spotlight:
  categories:
    revenue: # Required, this is the name of the category, and how it will be referenced in the catalog. It must be unique.
      label: Revenue # Required, this is what will be displayed in the catalog
      color: "orange" # Optional, defaults to "gray", with the option to choose from a range of colors: "gray", "violet", "red", "orange", "green", "blue", "indigo", "pink", "yellow"
```

2. Now that you've added a category, you can assign metrics to it by adding a `categories` field to your models `.yml` file.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        meta:
          spotlight:
            visibility: show
            categories:
              - revenue
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        config:
          meta:
            spotlight:
              visibility: show
              categories:
                - revenue
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will add the `revenue` category to all metrics in the events model.

If you want to add another category to a specific metric, you can do so by adding the `categories` field to the metric's `.yml` file. And remember, you can only add categories that have been defined in the `lightdash.config.yml` file.

3. Now you can add the `marketing` category to the `event_count` metric:
   So in your `lightdash.config.yml` file, you need to have another category. Let's call it `marketing` and add it to the `event_count` metric, like so:

```yml
spotlight:
  categories:
    marketing:
      label: Marketing
      color: "blue"
    revenue:
      label: Revenue
      color: "orange"
```

Now you can add the `marketing` category to the `event_count` metric:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        meta:
          spotlight:
            visibility: show
            categories:
              - revenue
          metrics:
            event_count:
              type: count
              spotlight:
                categories:
                  - marketing
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        config:
          meta:
            spotlight:
              visibility: show
              categories:
                - revenue
            metrics:
              event_count:
                type: count
                spotlight:
                  categories:
                    - marketing
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

In this example, the `event_count` metric will have both the `marketing` and `revenue` categories, it's cumulative.

4. Once you compile your project, you'll see the `event_count` metric in the catalog with both the `marketing` and `revenue` categories and you can use this to filter your metrics in the catalog.

<Info>
  **The categories you define need to be unique, so you can't have two categories with the same name.**

  If you try to add a category with the same name as an existing category, you'll get an error. This error will be displayed in the UI and in the terminal (if you use the Lightdash CLI) when you compile your project.
</Info>

## Assigning owners to metrics

You can assign owners to metrics using the `spotlight.owner` property. The owner displays in the metrics catalog with their name and avatar.

### Set an owner at the metric level

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: amount
            meta:
              metrics:
                total_revenue:
                  type: sum
                  spotlight:
                    owner: alice@yourcompany.com
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: amount
            config:
              meta:
                metrics:
                  total_revenue:
                    type: sum
                    spotlight:
                      owner: alice@yourcompany.com
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Set a default owner at the model level

You can set a default owner for all metrics in a model. Metric-level owners override the model-level default.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        meta:
          spotlight:
            owner: bob@yourcompany.com  # default for all metrics in this model
        columns:
          - name: amount
            meta:
              metrics:
                total_revenue:
                  type: sum
                  spotlight:
                    owner: alice@yourcompany.com  # overrides model owner
                avg_revenue:
                  type: average
                  # inherits bob@yourcompany.com from model
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        config:
          meta:
            spotlight:
              owner: bob@yourcompany.com  # default for all metrics in this model
        columns:
          - name: amount
            config:
              meta:
                metrics:
                  total_revenue:
                    type: sum
                    spotlight:
                      owner: alice@yourcompany.com  # overrides model owner
                  avg_revenue:
                    type: average
                    # inherits bob@yourcompany.com from model
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  - Use the email address of a Lightdash user in your organization.
  - Metric-level owner takes precedence over model-level.
  - You can filter by owner in the Spotlight UI.
  - If the email doesn't match a Lightdash user, the metric shows as "Unassigned".
</Info>

## Controlling filtering and segmentation options

You can control which dimensions appear in the filter and segment-by dropdowns when exploring metrics. This helps users focus on relevant dimensions.

### Hide a dimension from all metrics

Use boolean values at the dimension level to hide a dimension from filter or segment-by dropdowns for all metrics in that model:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: internal_tracking_id
            meta:
              dimension:
                spotlight:
                  filter_by: false   # hide from filter dropdown
                  segment_by: false  # hide from segment-by dropdown
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: internal_tracking_id
            config:
              meta:
                dimension:
                  spotlight:
                    filter_by: false   # hide from filter dropdown
                    segment_by: false  # hide from segment-by dropdown
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Allowlist specific dimensions for a metric

Use an array of dimension names at the metric level to create an allowlist of dimensions for that specific metric:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: amount
            meta:
              metrics:
                total_revenue:
                  type: sum
                  spotlight:
                    filter_by:
                      - status
                      - region
                      - order_date
                    segment_by:
                      - status
                      - customer_segment
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: amount
            config:
              meta:
                metrics:
                  total_revenue:
                    type: sum
                    spotlight:
                      filter_by:
                        - status
                        - region
                        - order_date
                      segment_by:
                        - status
                        - customer_segment
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### How it works

- **Dimension-level (boolean, default `true`)**: Controls whether a dimension appears in dropdowns for all metrics in that model.
- **Metric-level (array of dimension names)**: Creates an allowlist of dimensions for that specific metric.
- **Metric-level allowlists override dimension-level settings**: If a dimension has `filter_by: false` but a metric includes it in its `filter_by` array, it will still be available for that metric.

### Use cases

- Hide internal/technical dimensions that aren't useful for analysis.
- Curate the exploration experience per metric (e.g., revenue metrics only filterable by business dimensions).
- Reduce clutter in models with many dimensions.

## Configuring default time settings in .yml

We recommend setting up default time fields to make it easier for your business users and save them time.

To pre-select a time field in the explore view, simply define the default settings in your Lightdash `.yml` files.

### Set a table-level default time dimension

1. Create or modify your table configuration in the .yml file. For example, to set a default time dimension on the events table:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        columns:
          - name: event_date
            description: "Event date"
            meta:
              dimension:
                label: "Event date"
                type: date
                time_intervals:
                  - DAY
          - name: event
            description: "Event"
            meta:
              dimension:
                type: string
              metrics:
                count:
                  type: count
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yml
    models:
      - name: events
        columns:
          - name: event_date
            description: "Event date"
            config:
              meta:
                dimension:
                  label: "Event date"
                  type: date
                  time_intervals:
                    - DAY
          - name: event
            description: "Event"
            config:
              meta:
                dimension:
                  type: string
                metrics:
                  count:
                    type: count
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Add the default time dimension at the table level:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: events
        meta:
          default_time_dimension:
            field: event_date
            interval: DAY
        columns:
          # ... your column definitions here
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: events
        config:
          meta:
            default_time_dimension:
              field: event_date
              interval: DAY
        columns:
          # ... your column definitions here
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

3. [Compile your project](/references/integrations/dbt-projects)

4. Navigate to the metrics catalog

5. Open any metrics from the events table

6. All metrics with that default time set will be plotted against the `event date` with day granularity `in the last 30 days`

### Set a metric-level default time dimension

This will override the time dimension defined on the table level.

1. Modify your existing table configuration to add a metric-level default time dimension:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: events
        meta:
          default_time_dimension:
            field: event_date
            interval: DAY
        columns:
          - name: event
            description: "Event"
            meta:

2. [Compile your project](/references/integrations/dbt-projects)

3. Navigate to the metrics catalog

4. Explore the Events' count metric

5. The metric will be plotted against the `event date` with **month** granularity, instead of the default **day** granularity applied to the table

## Canvas view (alpha)

The **Canvas View** is a powerful, flexible workspace designed for visualizing and organizing metrics in creative ways. A key use case is creating **Metric Trees** to visualize metric relationships, hierarchies, and dependencies. This visualization enables you to see how metrics impact your KPIs and compare performance over the previous month.

### How to use the ‘Canvas view’ for Metric trees:

1. **Filter your metrics**: Use the 'categories' or 'search' functions to narrow your list of metrics. Canvas view currently works best with fewer than 30 metrics to ensure smooth performance. Need help creating categories? [Learn more here](#browsing-the-catalog).

2. **Enable Canvas view**: Select **Canvas view** to activate the workspace.

3. **Add metrics**: Drag your desired metrics from the grey sidebar into the canvas workspace.

4. **Create connections**: Link metrics by dragging between nodes to build relationships and dependencies. Connected nodes will be saved and visible the next time you filter your metrics down by category.

5. **Remove nodes**: Select a node and press **Backspace** to delete it.

6. **Permissions**: Viewers can see trees created in the Canvas View but cannot make edits.

Canvas view is currently in alpha.

Your metric connections are saved, so the next time you filter by a category and switch to canvas view, you'll see your saved connections. However, the placement of any unconnected tiles will not be retained.

## FAQs

**a. What time intervals are supported?**

Currently, we only support: DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR

**b. What pre-filled filters are applied?**

* Time grain Year -> past 3 years

* Time grain Month -> past 12 months

* Time grain Week -> past 12 weeks

* Time grain Day -> past 30 days

So if one of your business users explores a metric with a default time grain of DAY, metrics will be shown for the past 30 days with granularity of days with the default time dimension prefilled.

**c. Can I pull through other metadata from my .yml files?**

Not yet, but soon you'll be able to manage metadata directly in the UI and sync it back to dbt.

**d. Which other metrics can I compare my selected metric by?**

1. **Metrics with defaults in `.yml`:** Metrics with a default time dimension specified in the `.yml` file will always appear.

2. **Metrics with a single time dimension:** Metrics from tables with only one time dimension will appear as it's assumed to be the most relevant.

3. **Metrics from joined tables:** Metrics from joined tables that meet the criteria in points 1 and 2 will also appear.

**e. How can I be sure that my yml changes are correct?**

If you use VSCode, you can use our Lightdash schema validation to check your yml files are correct.

1. Install this YAML extension for VSCode: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

2. Open your user settings in JSON format and add the following:

```json
"[yaml]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "redhat.vscode-yaml"
},
"yaml.schemas": {
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightdash/lightdash/refs/heads/main/packages/common/src/schemas/json/lightdash-dbt-2.0.json": [
    "*.yml",
    "/**/models/**/*.yml",
    "/**/models/**/*.yaml",
    "!lightdash.config.yml",
    "!dbt_project.yml"
  ],
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightdash/lightdash/refs/heads/main/packages/common/src/schemas/json/lightdash-project-config-1.0.json": [
    "lightdash.config.yml"
  ]
}
```

This will add schema validation to your model yml files and your lightdash.config.yml file.

3. Reload VSCode

4. You'll see a red squiggly line under any errors in your yml files as well as suggestions for how to fix them and what is allowed.
