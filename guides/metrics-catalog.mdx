  **The Spotlight features are currently in beta.**

  We're actively testing and improving them — some of the functionality might be subject to change.

## Getting Started

Spotlight features use your existing [Lightdash semantic layer](/guides/lightdash-semantic-layer) and metrics definitions, so you can get started today. Head to **Metrics** in the navigation bar to start exploring.

Spotlight is organized into two main views:

- **Catalog** — A searchable, filterable table of all your project metrics. Browse metrics by category, owner, or popularity, explore any metric over time in the Metrics Explorer, and curate what your business users see through `.yml` configuration.

- **Canvas** — A freeform workspace where you can drag metrics onto a canvas and draw connections between them to visualize metric trees, hierarchies, and dependencies.
