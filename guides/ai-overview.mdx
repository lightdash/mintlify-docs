Lightdash provides several ways to leverage AI across your analytics workflow. Each capability serves a different use case—from answering business questions to building your semantic layer to integrating with your own AI tools.

## AI capabilities at a glance

| Capability | Use case | Requirements |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| [Lightdash AI agents](#ai-agents) | Answer questions and create charts using your semantic layer | Cloud Pro or Enterprise add-on |
| [Lightdash Data MCP](#lightdash-data-mcp) | Query your semantic layer from external LLMs | Cloud Pro or Enterprise add-on |
| [Lightdash Docs MCP](#lightdash-docs-mcp) | Give your LLM context about Lightdash features | Free for everyone |
| [Agent skills for your CLI](#agent-skills) | Build and maintain your semantic layer with external AI coding agents | Free for everyone |

## Lightdash AI agents

<Info>
  Available as an add-on for Cloud Pro and Enterprise plans. [View pricing](https://www.lightdash.com/pricing)
</Info>

AI agents let your team ask questions in natural language and get instant answers. They use your saved dashboards and the metrics defined in your semantic layer, so business users can find insights without writing code or learning complex tools.

**Best for:** Business users who want to explore data and create visualizations without technical knowledge.

**Key features:**
- Natural language queries with automatic visualizations
- Slack integration for team collaboration
- Memory and learning from corrections
- Fine-grained access control
- Evaluations to validate agent accuracy

## Lightdash Data MCP

<Info>
  Available for Cloud Pro and Enterprise plans. [View pricing](https://www.lightdash.com/pricing)
</Info>

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) lets you connect external AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT directly to your Lightdash data. Use your preferred LLM to explore data models, search for metrics, and get data-driven insights—all while respecting your existing access controls.

**Best for:** Teams who want to use their own AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, custom agents) to query Lightdash data outside the Lightdash UI.

**Key features:**
- Connect Claude, ChatGPT, or custom agents to your Lightdash instance
- Browse and query your data models
- OAuth authentication with existing permissions
- Read-only access for security

The Docs MCP endpoint gives AI coding agents access to the complete Lightdash documentation. This helps your LLM understand Lightdash concepts, generate accurate YAML configurations, and troubleshoot issues using official documentation.

**Best for:** Developers who want their AI coding tools to have context about Lightdash when working on configurations.

**Key features:**
- Full access to Lightdash documentation
- No authentication required
- Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible tools
