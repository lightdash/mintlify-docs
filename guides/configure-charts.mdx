Most chart types have very similar configuration options, so we put them all together below.

## Layout

This is where you can pick the columns from your results table that you want to plot on your x and y axes or that you want to group by.

You can group by up to 3 fields in your chart.

For bar charts, this is also where you have the option to stack your bars, or leave them unstacked (grouped).

## Series

The series tab is where you can adjust how your chart shows each data series. A **data series** is a set of related data points plotted on a chart. For example, the number of new users created each day over a set of dates is a series. In a bar chart, a series is represented by bars of the same color; in a line chart, a series is represented by a single line. You can see a list of the series for your chart in the **Series** menu, and on the chart legend.

The options available in here will depend on the data in your chart. But, in here you can:

- Set the chart type for each series
- Change series labels or colors
- Put series on a left or right y-axis
- Show value labels or group totals on data points
- Hide a series from your chart

## Axes

In this section you have options to:

- Override the default text for your axes labels
- Adjust sort order of your x-axis
- Rotate x-axis labels
- Set the min and max axis values for your y-axes (or keep the default auto y-axis range)
- Show x-axis and y-axis grid lines
- Hide x-axis completely
- Hide y-axis completely

## Display

This tab is where you're able to control the legend, reference lines, and [custom tooltips](/references/custom-tooltip) in your chart.

### Reference lines

You can add reference lines to your charts to easily visualize goals or thresholds.

</Frame>

To add a reference line, click `+ Add` under Display -> Reference lines.

You have these options in the settings:

- Select a field you want to linke to your reference line (Page views in the image above)
- Set a static value (50,000 in the image above)
- Add a label (`Halfway to our goal!` in the image above)
- Change the line color (green in the image above)

<Tip>
  Most reference lines are static values, but you can also use these key words to plot a dynamic value: `min`, `max`, `median`, `average`.

  That way your reference line will automatically update to the global min, max, median, or average of the field you selected. See image below for examples.
</Tip>

If you select a field plotted on your x-axis, then your line will be vertical. If you select a field plotted on your y-axis, then your line will be horizontal.

<Tip>
  If your reference line label is cropped off your chart, try adjusting your [right margin](#margins).
</Tip>

### Legend

You can add and adjust the legend in your chart to help people understand what data's been plotted.

- Show or hide the legend
- Adjust the position of the legend on your chart
  - The values in `position` are the coordinates of the legend on your chart. They can either be numbers or percent. We suggest using %.
  - If you want the position to be in the bottom right, you would set: Right = 0%, Bottom = 0%. For the legend to be in the middle of the chart, you'd set: Top = 50%, Left = 50%.
- Set your legend to scroll (if you have so many groups that they overlap your chart)
- Orient the values in your legened to form a list vertically, or horizontally

## Margins

The Margin tab is where you're able to add or remove margin around the grid. Removing margin means that your chart will fill more of the space in the chart tab. Adding margin will shrink your chart into a smaller space.

You can either add numbers (e.g. 50) or percent values (e.g. 50%) to the margin settings listed. The default margin is set to `top` = 70, `bottom` = 30, `left` = 5%, `right` = 5%
