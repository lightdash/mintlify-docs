In Lightdash, the data in your results tables can be visualized in a bunch of different ways:

- [Bar chart](/references/chart-types/bar-chart)
- [Horizontal bar chart](/references/chart-types/horizontal-bar-chart)
- [Line chart](/references/chart-types/line-chart)
- [Area chart](/references/chart-types/area-chart)
- [Mixed chart](/references/chart-types/mixed-chart)
- [Scatter chart](/references/chart-types/scatter-chart)
- [Pie chart](/references/chart-types/pie-chart)
- [Funnel chart](/references/chart-types/funnel-chart)
- [Treemap chart](/references/chart-types/treemap-chart)
- [Table](/references/chart-types/table)
- [Big value](/references/chart-types/big-value)
- [Gauge](/references/chart-types/gauge)
- [Map](/references/chart-types/map)
- [Custom chart](/references/chart-types/custom-charts)

The visualization type that you pick determines how Lightdash shows the data series in your chart. To change how your data is displayed, click **Configure** when you're querying from a table. You have the option to change the chart type in the drop-down:
