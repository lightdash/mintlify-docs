Gauges are useful when you want to highlight a single value against a qualitative range, like performance against a target. They work well for KPIs and operational dashboards where you need an at-a-glance status.

To create a gauge chart:

- Choose a single metric as the value to display.
- Optionally define min and max bounds for the scale.
- Configure colored ranges to communicate thresholds (for example: red, amber, green bands).

Tips:

- Use gauges sparingly and for monitoring, not detailed analysis.
- Prefer descriptive labels and units so the value is immediately clear to viewers.
