Treemaps show parts of a whole using nested rectangles. Each rectangle's size represents the value of a metric, and dimensions define how the data is grouped and nested. You can use a single dimension or multiple and they will work as described below.

**One dimension**: Each category becomes a rectangle, sized by the metric value.

**Two dimensions**: Creates a hierarchy where each rectangle is split into sub-rectangles based on the second dimension.

**Three or more dimensions**: The chart displays the top-level hierarchy. Users can click to drill down into deeper layers.

Treemaps are useful when:

- You want to compare proportions across categories
- You're visualizing hierarchical data
- Space is limited and you want a compact alternative to bar or pie charts

To create a treemap, select **Treemap** as the chart type and choose your dimensions.

## Layout

- **Dimension hierarchy** tells Lightdash how to group or nest the dimensions.
- **Size metric** determines how large each section of the treemap chart is.
- **Color metric** allows you to set a color scale for Highlighting each section of the treemap.

## Display

- **Minimum section size** determines when to start hiding sections, anything smaller than this size can be shown by zooming in.
- **Max leaf depth** allows you to choose when a user needs to start drilling into sections to see the next tier, default value is 2.
