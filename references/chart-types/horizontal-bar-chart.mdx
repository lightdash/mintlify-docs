Horizontal bar charts are just bar charts, except the columns are placed on the chart horizontally instead of vertically.

Horizontal bar charts are useful when:

- you're trying to group a number by something with a lot of possible values.
- your groups have really long label names.

You can see more details about horizontal bar chart configurations [here](/guides/configure-charts).
