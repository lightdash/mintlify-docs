The Table option is good for looking at (surprise, surprise) tabular data, or for lists of things like user IDs or transactions.

The options for Tables include:

- Renaming the columns in your table.
- Showing and hiding the columns in your table.
- Showing and hiding the table name from the column labels.
- Showing and hiding the totals for your columns.
- Pivoting by a column.
- Transposing your table (a.k.a. pivoting your metrics)
- Locking a column from scrolling in your table.
- Resizing columns by dragging the column header edge.
- Adding conditional formatting to your cells.

By default, we attach the table name to your field name (just in case you've got any duplicate fields from joined tables). But, you can easily turn this off in your table viz with a toggle.

## Columns, rows, and metrics

Table visualizations have three components:

- **Rows**: When a field is chosen for the row area, all of the unique values for that field are populated as values in the _rows_ of your table.
- **Columns**: When a field is chosen for the column area, all of the unique values for that field are populated as values in the _columns_ of your table.
- **Metrics**: If you have metrics in your table, then each metric cell shows the summarized information for a given row + column combination.

## Adding tiny bars to table visualization

You can also enable tiny bars on each table cell, to improve visual feedback.

To configure this, go to `bar display` on the sidebar, and select the `numeric` columns. We'll calculate the min/max values , and we will display a tiny bar next to the value on the table

This feature also works on pivot tables

## Pivot tables

Pivot tables allow you to summarize larger sets of data in table visualizations by moving row values into columns. They're also helpful to identify trends between two dimensions in your data using a table visualization.

To add a pivot in your table, move a dimension to the `column` section of your table configuration. This will change the dimension from having its values populate the rows values of your table, to having it populate the column values of your table.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/chart-types/pivoted-table-72daaf2e205221bd425e61dd1b6dc883.jpg)
</Frame>

You can move up to 3 dimensions as columns.

### Column limits

Pivot tables have a default limit of 200 columns to ensure good performance. Large pivot tables with many columns can significantly slow down query execution and rendering times, so this limit helps keep your dashboards responsive.

<Tip>
  If you have a Lightdash Pro or Enterprise account, this limit can be increased at your request. If you are self-hosting, you can set the pivot column limit by updating the [`LIGHTDASH_PIVOT_TABLE_MAX_COLUMN_LIMIT`](/self-host/customize-deployment/environment-variables) environment variable.
</Tip>

The column limit works differently depending on whether you have metrics as rows or metrics as columns:

#### When metrics are columns (default)

When metrics are displayed as columns (the default behavior), each pivoted dimension value creates a column for **every metric**. This means the total number of columns equals the number of unique dimension values multiplied by the number of metrics.

For example, if you pivot by `order_date_month` (with 36 months of data) and have 3 metrics:
- Total columns: 36 months × 3 metrics = 108 columns which is within the column limit of 200

The limit always applies to complete dimension values — a dimension value is either fully shown (with all of its metrics) or not shown at all. The number of dimension values displayed is determined by dividing the column limit by the number of metrics and rounding down.

With a column limit of 200 and 3 metrics:
- Maximum dimension values: `floor(200 / 3)` = 66 months

Here's what a pivoted table looks like with `order_date_month` pivoted to columns and 3 metrics:

<img src="/images/references/chart-types/table/pivot_column_limit_example_1_light.png" alt="Pivot column limit example" className="block dark:hidden" />
<img src="/images/references/chart-types/table/pivot_column_limit_example_1_dark.png" alt="Pivot column limit example" className="hidden dark:block" />

If too many columns are generated as a result of your pivot configuration, you will see a warning that your results may be incomplete. This often happens when you pivot by multiple dimensions.

For example, if you pivot by both `order_date_month` and `browser` (with 6 distinct values) and have 3 metrics, the maximum number of months displayed is:
- Maximum dimension values: `floor(200 / (6*3))` = 11 months

The warning looks like this:
<img src="/images/references/chart-types/table/column_limit_exceeded_light.png" alt="Pivot column limit exceeded" className="block dark:hidden" />
<img src="/images/references/chart-types/table/column_limit_exceeded_dark.png" alt="Pivot column limit exceeded" className="hidden dark:block" />

To reduce the number of pivot columns, you can: 
- filter your data, e.g., filter your months to only show data from the last year
- reduce the number of dimensions you are pivoting on, e.g., decide whether splitting your data by both `order_date_month` and `browser` is necessary
- reduce the granularity of your pivot dimensions, e.g., pivot by `order_date_year` instead of `order_date_month`
- show metrics as rows instead of columns (see below)

#### When metrics are rows

When you enable **Show metrics as rows**, each pivoted dimension value creates only **one column**, regardless of how many metrics you have. The metrics are displayed as separate rows instead.

For example, if you have `partner_name` as a row dimension (with 5 partners), pivot by `order_date_month` (with 12 months of data), and have 3 metrics:
- Total columns: 12 (one per month)
- Each row is repeated once per metric — so you'll see 5 × 3 = 15 rows

Here's what the same data looks like with metrics as rows, where the row dimension is `partner_name`:

<img src="/images/references/chart-types/table/metrics_as_rows_light.png" alt="Metrics as rows" className="block dark:hidden" />
<img src="/images/references/chart-types/table/metrics_as_rows_dark.png" alt="Metrics as rows" className="hidden dark:block" />

With 12 months, this creates only 12 columns, compared to 36 columns when metrics are columns.

This means you can display significantly more dimension values when using metrics as rows, which is useful when you have many metrics to compare across time periods or other dimensions.

## Totals

You can add column totals or row totals (in pivot tables) to your tables by selecting `Show column totals` or `Show row totals` in the chart configuration panel. The column totals in your results and table visualizations are calculated using the underlying data from your table, not only the values that are visible in the table.

<Info>
  Totals are not calculated for table calculations. Also, in pivot tables, totals are only shown for `count` and `sum` metric types.
</Info>

### Incorrect totals

**Why are my totals lower?**

When using the `count_distinct` metric type, you can sometimes get totals that are smaller than if you sum up the values seen in the table.

For example, if you count the distinct number of devices that viewed pages on our website each month, it would look something like this:

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/chart-types/tables-lower-total-17b9669a5d61613bf9d9a1a800138fd7.png)
</Frame>

If you manually add each row in the `Anonymous device count` column, the value you get is much higher than the total shown in the table. This is because the same device can view pages on our website across many months. So, when you add up the values in the table, you'll be counting some devices more than once.

Lightdash uses a SQL query to calculate the distinct number of devices across all of the months so we avoid double-counting devices.

**Why are my totals higher?**

There are two reasons why this could be happening:

1. You've set a row limit in your query that's truncating the results. If the number of possible results from your query is larger than the row limit you've set, Lightdash will calculate the totals using all of the results (including the rows that have been removed from your table because of the limit).
2. You're using metric or table calculation filters. When you use metric or table calculation filters, the totals are calculated before the filters are applied.

**How do I calculate totals based on what's shown in my table?**

If you want to calculate totals based on just the values shown in your table, you can create a new column using a table calculation to do this.

Here's the table calculation you'll need to use to do this:

```sql
SUM(${my_table_name.my_metric_name}) OVER()
```

<Info>
  This calculation isn't a "true" total when you're using metrics types that are `count_distinct`!
</Info>

## Subtotals

You can add subtotals to your tables by selecting `Show subtotals` in the chart configuration panel.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/chart-types/subtotals-69de33b7bb4a868d33b713d61002a782.png)
</Frame>

To use subtotals, you need to have at least 2 or more dimensions in your table visualization.

## Freeze columns

If you have a wide table, you may want some columns to be locked to the left while you're scrolling. Click on the lock icon beside the column(s) you want to keep pinned to the left of your table visualization to lock them in place.

![](/images/references/chart-types/table-freeze-column.png)

## Resize columns

You can drag to resize columns in both pivot and non-pivot tables. This feature is available in Explore view when in edit mode.

To resize a column:
1. Hover over the right edge of a column header to reveal the resize handle
2. Drag the handle left or right to adjust the column width
3. Release to set the new width

Column widths are saved with the chart configuration, so your changes are visible to everyone viewing the chart. Text that overflows a resized column will display with an ellipsis.

<Tip>
You can see the current column width in the column configuration panel, which also includes a reset button to restore the default width. Columns have a minimum width of 50px to prevent them from disappearing.
</Tip>

## Conditional formatting

Sometimes it's helpful to highlight certain values in your tables when they meet a specific condition. You can set up conditional formatting rules by going to the **Configure** tab, then **Conditional Formatting**.

![](/images/references/chart-types/conditional-formatting-d7ad3652e9381b8bf60b416a110e7760.png)

### Highlighting cells

When you add a new rule, you'll first need to pick which column should be highlighted and the type of rule you'd like to apply (**Single** or **Range**). There are three ways to compare data for each role:

1. **Values** compares the chosen field to manual input values.

- For example, color the `Profit` column red when a row is less than \$10,000

2. **Field** compares the chosen field to another field in your results.

- For example, color the `Revenue` column green when it is greater than the `Target revenue` column.

3. **Field values** compares another field in your results to manual input values, then formats your chosen field.

- For example, color the `Partner name` column orange when the `Total orders` column is greater than 1,000.

You can set as many rules on a table as you want. If two or more rules disagree with each other, the rule that's on the bottom of your list of rules will win.

### Color ranges

To use color ranges for your rules, select **Range** under **Conditional Formatting**. You can choose specific minimum and maximum values, or you can automatically set them based on the values in your results.

![](/images/references/chart-types/table-conditional-format-range.png)

The color range will use a set of 5 colors mapped across the min and max colors selected in your rule.
