The Big value option is for displaying a single value, well, big.

The Big value works for any type of value: string, numeric, boolean, you name it! We always display the first value from the field in your results table.

The options for Big value include:

- Selecting which field you want to use for your Big value.
- Updating the label below the Big value value.
- Adding a comparison to the previous row
  - Show raw value or percentage change
  - Show red or green for positive or negative change
  - Label your comparison value
