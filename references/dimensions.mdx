description: "Dimensions are the columns in your table. They are the \"attributes\" of your data. For example, `user_id` in your users table is a dimension."
sidebarTitle: "Dimensions"

Dimensions usually match 1:1 with columns in your dbt models (see [additional dimensions](#additional-dimensions) for counterexamples).

## Adding dimensions to your project

Read more about [adding dimensions to your project in our docs here](/get-started/develop-in-lightdash/how-to-create-dimensions).

For a dimension to appear in Lightdash, you just need to declare it in your dbt model's YAML file.

```yaml
models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: user_id # will be "User id" in LightDash
        description: "Unique identifier for a user."
```


## Dimension configuration

To customize the dimension, you can do it in your dbt model's YAML file under the `meta` tag. The syntax depends on your dbt version.

If you want to declare multiple dimensions based on the same column, check [additional dimensions](#additional-dimensions) section.

The table below shows all the dimension properties you can customize:

| Property | Required | Value  | Description |
| :------- | :------- | :----- | :---------- |
| label    | No       | string | Custom label. If you set this property, this is what you'll see in Lightdash instead of the dimension name. |
| [type](#type) | No  | Dimension type | The dimension type is automatically pulled from your table schemas in Lightdash but you can override the type using this property. |
| [description](#description) | No    | string | Description of the dimension in Lightdash. You can use this to override the description you have for the dimension in dbt. |
| sql | No            | string | Custom SQL applied to the column used to define the dimension. |
| [time_intervals](#time-intervals) | No | 'default' or OFF or an array[] containing elements of [date](#date-options), [numeric](#numeric-options) or [string](#string-options) options | 'default' (or not setting the time_intervals property) will be converted into ['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'QUARTER', 'YEAR'] for dates and ['RAW', 'DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'QUARTER', 'YEAR'] for timestamps; if you want no time intervals set 'OFF'. |
| hidden | No       | boolean | If set to true, the dimension is hidden from Lightdash. By default, this is set to false if you don't include this property. Hidden dimensions are also excluded from drilldowns (View underlying data). |
| [compact](#compact) | No     | string | This option will compact the number value (e.g. 1,500 to 1.50K). Currently supports one of the following: ['thousands', 'millions', 'billions', 'trillions', 'kilobytes', 'megabytes', 'gigabytes', 'terabytes', 'petabytes', 'kibibytes', 'mebibytes', 'gibibytes', 'tebibytes', 'pebibytes'] |
| [format](#format) | No       | string | This option will format the output value on the results table and CSV export. Supports spreadsheet-style formatting (e.g. #,##0.00). Use [this website](https://customformats.com) to help build your custom format. |
| [groups](#groups) | No       | string or string[] | If you set this property, the dimension will be grouped in the sidebar with other dimensions with the same group label. |
| [urls](#urls) | No       | Array of  `url`, `label`  | Adding urls to a dimension allows your users to click dimension values in the UI and take actions, like opening an external tool with a url, or open at a website. You can use liquid templates to customise the link based on the value of the dimension. |
| [required_attributes](#required-attributes) | No    | Object with `user_attribute`, `value`  | Limits access to users with those attributes |
| [colors](#color)  | No       | Object with `value`, `color`  | Color for the values in the chart |
| [image](#image-display)  | No       | Object with `url`  | **[WIP]** Display images in table cells using URL templates. Supports LiquidJS templating for dynamic URLs. |


## Type

The types of your dimensions are pulled from your data warehouse, automatically. You can override these types using the `type` meta tag in your .yml file. If you run `lightdash generate` to generate your .yml files, then Lightdash will add the `type` from your data warehouse to your .yml files automatically.

## Description

Column descriptions in your YAML file are automatically pulled into Lightdash and you can spot them if you hover over the dimension name.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/screenshot-column-descriptions-3498d7b3c09c38fda5b755ce21358b2c.png)
</Frame>

Descriptions support any formatting that works with YAML, but the three characters used most often are:

### Quotes for escaping

When you surround text with double or single quotes it will escape the text between so that any special characters recognized by YAML will still pass through to the Lightdash UI.

```yaml
description: 'The contents of this column include this & that.'
```

### Greater than symbol for folded text blocks

When you use `>-` it allows you to type descriptions that are multiple lines long in the YAML file, but the text will be combined into a single line when parsed. The `lightdash generate` command will automatically add this to keep YAML files easy to read.

This description in YAML:

```yaml
- name: product_tier
  description: >-
    This is a longer description...
    ...that requires multiple lines
    and it will be combined in the Lightdash UI
```

Will appear like this in the Lightdash UI:

```yaml
This is a longer description......that requires multiple lines and it will be combined in the Lightdash UI
```

### Vertical bar for preserving line breaks

If you need line breaks to stay in place when they show up in the Lightdash UI, you can use a `|` character like this:

```yaml
- name: product_tier
  description: |
    This is a longer description...
    ...that requires multiple lines
    and it will stay on multiple lines
```

And in Lightdash UI it will appear like this:

```yaml
This is a longer description...
...that requires multiple lines
and it will stay on multiple lines
```

### Using dbt doc blocks

You can also use dbt docs blocks in descriptions, [more on that here](/guides/cli/how-to-auto-generate-schema-files#using-doc-blocks-to-build-better-yml-files).

## Format

You can use the `format` parameter to have your dimensions show in a particular format in Lightdash. Lightdash supports spreadsheet-style format expressions for all dimension types.

To help you build your format expression, we recommend using https://customformats.com/.

<Accordion title="(Legacy) format and round options">
  Spreadsheet-style format expressions are the recommended way of adding formatting to your metrics in Lightdash. There are legacy formatting options, listed below, which are less flexible than the spreadsheet-style formatting.

  <Info>
    If you use both legacy and spreadsheet-style formatting options for a single dimension, Lightdash will ignore the legacy `format` and `round` options and only apply the spreadsheet-style formatting expression.

  #### Round (legacy)

  You can round values to appear with a certain number of decimal points.

## Compact

You can compact values in your YAML. For example, if I wanted all of my revenue values to be shown in thousands (e.g. `1,500` appears as `1.50K`), then I would write something like this in my .yml:

## Time intervals

Lightdash automatically adds intervals for dimensions that are timestamps or dates, so you don't have to!

For example, here we have the timestamp dimension `created` defined in our dbt project:

```yaml
- name: created
  description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
```

Lightdash breaks this out into the default intervals automatically. So, this is how `created` appears in our Lightdash project:

<Frame>
  ![screenshot-default-intervals](/images/references/screenshot-default-intervals-1fb6e04e2d4f617bb22f9fea86fa52c6.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
  [**Formatting added to a date or timestamp dimension will be applied to all of the time intervals for that dimension.**](#format)

  If you want to apply different formats for different time intervals, we recommend creating [additional dimensions](#additional-dimensions) for time intervals where you want to customize the format.
</Info>


### Default time intervals

The default time intervals that Lightdash adds are...

**For `date` type**: 

```yaml
['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'QUARTER', 'YEAR']
```

**For `timestamp` type**: 

```yaml
['RAW', 'DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'QUARTER', 'YEAR']
```

### Disable time intervals

If you want to turn off time intervals for a dimension, you set the `time_intervals` property to `OFF`.

In this example, `created` would now appear as a single, timestamp dimension without a drop-down list of time intervals in Lightdash:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    - name: created
      description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
      meta:
        dimension:
          type: timestamp
          time_intervals: OFF
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    - name: created
      description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
      config:
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: timestamp
            time_intervals: OFF
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  ![screenshot-intervals-off](/images/references/screenshot-intervals-off-e786a3290b6c8b8454fe7f223a5682d8.png)
</Frame>


### To customize the time intervals for a dimension, you can use the `time_intervals` parameter.

If you specify time intervals manually, then this overrides the default time intervals used by Lightdash.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    - name: created
      description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
      meta:
        dimension:
          time_intervals: ['DAY', 'DAY_OF_MONTH_NUM', 'MONTH', 'QUARTER_NAME', 'YEAR']
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    - name: created
      description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
      config:
        meta:
          dimension:
            time_intervals: ['DAY', 'DAY_OF_MONTH_NUM', 'MONTH', 'QUARTER_NAME', 'YEAR']
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can see all of the standard interval options for date and timestamp fields below. You can also add custom intervals using _additional dimensions_, there's an example below the following tables.

| QUARTER_NAME     | Quarter name    | String | Q3              |


### Custom time intervals

You can set custom versions of time intervals by using additional dimensions and groups. Here's an example of how that might look if you wanted to add `year_of_week_iso` to your drop down list for the `delivery_date` dimension. Note that by definiting the `groups:` option, we ensure that the new "Year of week" options is displayed as expected.



<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    - name: delivery_date
      meta:
        dimension:
          label: "Delivery Date"
          type: date
          time_intervals: [ ... ]
        additional_dimensions:
          year_of_week_num:
            type: number
            label: "Year of week"
            sql: "yearofweekiso(${delivery_date})"
            groups: ["Delivery Date"]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    - name: delivery_date
      config:
        meta:
          dimension:
            label: "Delivery Date"
            type: date
            time_intervals: [ ... ]
          additional_dimensions:
            year_of_week_num:
              type: number
              label: "Year of week"
              sql: "yearofweekiso(${delivery_date})"
              groups: ["Delivery Date"]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Reference time intervals in other dimensions

You can reference specific time intervals of a dimension in other dimensions. When you define time intervals for a dimension (like `session_start`), Lightdash creates separate dimensions for each interval (e.g., `session_start_day`, `session_start_month`). You can reference these in custom SQL for other dimensions.

For example, if you have a `user_created_at` dimension with time intervals defined, you can calculate the duration between two dates using the `DAY` interval:

```yaml
  - name: user_created_at
    meta:
      dimension:
        type: timestamp
        time_intervals:
        - DAY_OF_WEEK_NAME
        - WEEK
        - MONTH
        - RAW
        - DAY
        - HOUR_OF_DAY_NUM
        - QUARTER
  - name: first_purchase_at
    meta:
      dimension:
        type: timestamp
        time_intervals:
        - DAY
        - MONTH
        - QUARTER
  - name: duration
    meta:
      dimension:
        type: number
        sql: EXTRACT(DAY FROM ${first_purchase_at_day} - ${user_created_at_day})
```

In this example, `${user_created_at_day}` and `${first_purchase_at_day}` reference the `DAY` time interval versions of the `user_created_at` and `first_purchase_at` dimensions.

## Groups

You can group your dimensions and metrics in the sidebar using the `groups` parameter.

To do this, you need to set up `group_details` in the model's configuration. Then, you can use these groups to organize metrics and dimensions. You can create nested groups up to 3 levels.

                description: 'Fields that have information about the products in the basket.'
              item_details:
                label: Item Details
                description: 'Fields that have information about the items in the basket.'

        columns:
          - name: basket_item_id
            description: 'ID for the product item within the basket.'
            config:
              meta:
                dimension:
                  groups: ['product_details', 'item_details'] # this would add the dimension to a nested group: `product details` --> `item details`
          - name: product_name
            description: 'Full name of the product.'
            config:
              meta:
                dimension:
                  label: 'Product name'
                  groups: ['product_details'] # this would add the dimension under the group label: `product_details`
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## URLs

Lightdash users can interact with dimension values by clicking on them. If you're already storing URLs in your models, you can create hyperlinks to those URLs in Lightdash, like so:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: candidate_profile_url
        label: URL of the candidate profile
        meta:
          dimension:
            urls:
              - label: Open in CRM
                url: ${ value.raw }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: candidate_profile_url
        label: URL of the candidate profile
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              urls:
                - label: Open in CRM
                  url: ${ value.raw }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### How to add custom URLs

By adding custom urls you can configure the actions available to your users. Like linking to external tools, or taking actions in other tools.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/clickable-dimension-link-70554874d4e468900e9d8fadf3b53cd2.jpg)
</Frame>

In the example below, users can click on a company name and open a corresponding record in their CRM or search for the company in google or open that company's Slack channel.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: company_name
        label: Registered trading name of the company
        meta:
          dimension:
            urls:
              - label: Search for company in Google
                url: 'https://google.com/search?${ value.formatted | url_encode }'
              - label: Open in CRM
                url: 'https://mycrm.com/companies/${ row.company.company_id.raw | url_encode }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: company_name
        label: Registered trading name of the company
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              urls:
                - label: Search for company in Google
                  url: 'https://google.com/search?${ value.formatted | url_encode }'
                - label: Open in CRM
                  url: 'https://mycrm.com/companies/${ row.company.company_id.raw | url_encode }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The `${ value.formatted }` will be replaced with the value of the company name in the Lightdash UI at query run time. The `${ row.company.company_id.raw }` will be replaced with the value of the company id in the Lightdash UI at query run time. The action will be disabled if the column "company_id" from table "company" is not part of the query.


### You can reference values from other columns in your URLs

You can reference another dimension from your table in your URL. For these URLs to work, the other column you've referenced needs to be included in your results table. For example, say I've added a URL to `company_name` and it uses the field `customer_id`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: company_name
        label: Registered trading name of the company
        meta:
          dimension:
            urls:
              - label: "Open company"
                url: "https://example.com/company/${row.customers.customer_id.raw | url_encode }"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: company_name
        label: Registered trading name of the company
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              urls:
                - label: "Open company"
                  url: "https://example.com/company/${row.customers.customer_id.raw | url_encode }"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This URL will only work if I have `customer_id` included in my results table.


### Liquid Templating

Use templates to configure the url values depending on the query, this allows your urls to depend on the results of queries.

**Available liquid tags**

| Tag                                         | Description                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `${ value.formatted }`                      | The exact value of the dimension as seen in the Lightdash UI. For example `$1,427.20`       |
| `${ value.raw }`                            | The raw value of the dimension returned from the underlying SQL query. For example `1427.2` |
| `${ row.table_name.column_name.formatted }` | The exact value of the column as seen in the Lightdash UI. For example `$1,427.20`          |
| `${ row.table_name.column_name.raw }`       | The raw value of the dimension returned from the underlying SQL query. For example `1427.2` |

**Available liquid filters**

Filters can be used to make small transformations of your values:

- `url_encode`: Encode a string as URL safe, for example it replaces spaces with `%20`.

  ```liquid
  ${ value.formatted | url_encode }
  ```

- `downcase`: Convert a string to lowercase.

  ```liquid
  ${ value.formatted | downcase }
  ```

- `append`: Append one string to another.

  ```liquid
  ${ value.formatted | append: ".html" }
  ```

There are [many more filters available in the Liquid documentation](https://liquidjs.com/filters/overview.html).


## Required attributes

Lightdash can use `user attributes` to limit some dimensions to some users.

In the example below, only users with `is_admin` attribute `true` can use the `salary` dimension on `user` table. Users without access to this dimension will not see it or the custom metrics created from this dimension on the `explore page`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name:
        description: User name
      - salary:
        description: User salary
        meta:
          dimension:
            required_attributes:
              is_admin: "true"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name:
        description: User name
      - salary:
        description: User salary
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              required_attributes:
                is_admin: "true"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If a user without access to this dimension runs a query that contains this dimension, they will get a `Forbidden` error.


### Current limitations

Lightdash dimensions and custom metrics are protected by this feature, however, it is possible to write custom SQL to bypass this filter, for example:

- Developers and admins running SQL queries on SQL runner.
- Custom SQL or subqueries on `table calculations`

<Info>
  Scheduler deliveries will run against the user who created the scheduled delivery, be careful when sharing required attributes with other users.
</Info>


## Color

You can predefine colors for your string type dimensions, these colors will be used instead of your default organization colors for the right value when you use a grouped bar chart or a pie chart.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
      - name: status
        description: "{{ doc(\"orders_status\") }}"
        meta:
          dimension:
            colors:
              "placed": "#e6fa0f"
              "completed": "#558B2F"
              "shipped": "#29B6F6"
              "return_pending": "#FF6F00"
              "returned": "#E91E63"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
      - name: status
        description: "{{ doc(\"orders_status\") }}"
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              colors:
                "placed": "#e6fa0f"
                "completed": "#558B2F"
                "shipped": "#29B6F6"
                "return_pending": "#FF6F00"
                "returned": "#E91E63"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/pie-chart-color-b5c761ad3dc797717c6397920572b1c4.png)
</Frame>

<Info>
  We recommend using #HEX colors, other color types like rgba,rgba or color name (eg: orange) are also supported on charts, but they are not yet supported on the chart config.
</Info>

<Info>
  You can manually override these dimension colors by going into the chart config and manually picking a color for that serie.

  These colors will also take precedence over the organization color palette.
</Info>


## Image Display

<Warning>
  **Work in Progress**: This feature is currently in development and may be subject to changes.
</Warning>

You can configure dimensions to display images in table cells using URL templates. Images are rendered as thumbnails with hover tooltips showing larger previews, perfect for visualizing product images, user avatars, or any other image-based data.


### How it works

To display images, you define an `image` property with a URL template in your dimension or additional dimension configuration. The URL can be dynamic, using LiquidJS templating to construct URLs based on row data and field values.

**Simplest example - column already contains image URLs:**

If your column already contains complete image URLs, you can simply configure it to display as an image:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: image_url
        description: "Image URL for the event"
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
            image:
              url: "${value.raw}"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: image_url
        description: "Image URL for the event"
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              type: string
              image:
                url: "${value.raw}"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**With custom dimensions and fit:**

You can control the size and display behavior of images using width, height, and fit options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: product_image_url
        description: "Product image URL"
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
            image:
              url: "${value.raw}"
              width: 100
              height: 100
              fit: "cover"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: product_image_url
        description: "Product image URL"
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              type: string
              image:
                url: "${value.raw}"
                width: 100
                height: 100
                fit: "cover"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Basic example with URL template:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: product_id
        meta:
          additional_dimensions:
            product_image:
              type: string
              label: "Product Image"
              description: "Product thumbnail image"
              image:
                url: "https://example.com/images/${value.raw}.jpg"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: product_id
        config:
          meta:
            additional_dimensions:
              product_image:
                type: string
                label: "Product Image"
                description: "Product thumbnail image"
                image:
                  url: "https://example.com/images/${value.raw}.jpg"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Advanced example with dynamic URLs:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: event_type
        meta:
          additional_dimensions:
            event_image:
              type: string
              label: "Event Image"
              description: "Event banner image"
              image:
                url: "https://cdn.example.com/${value.raw}-${row.events.event_id.raw | upcase}.png"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: event_type
        config:
          meta:
            additional_dimensions:
              event_image:
                type: string
                label: "Event Image"
                description: "Event banner image"
                image:
                  url: "https://cdn.example.com/${value.raw}-${row.events.event_id.raw | upcase}.png"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Display behavior

- **Thumbnails**: Images display as thumbnails in table cells (default: 32px height)
- **Hover preview**: Hovering over a thumbnail reveals a larger preview via tooltip
- **Error handling**: Failed image loads show a photo-off icon with error details in the tooltip
- **Validation**: Invalid URL syntax is caught and displays an error state


### Image configuration properties

The `image` object supports the following properties:

| Property | Type   | Default | Description |
| :------- | :----- | :------ | :---------- |
| `url`    | string | (required) | The image URL. Supports LiquidJS templating with `${value.raw}`, `${row.table.column.raw}`, etc. |
| `width`  | number | auto | Image width in pixels. When specified without height, height defaults to 'auto' to maintain aspect ratio. |
| `height` | number | 32 | Image height in pixels. |
| `fit`    | string | "cover" | Controls how the image fits within the dimensions. Options: `"cover"`, `"contain"`, `"fill"`, or `"none"`. |

**Fit options:**

- **`cover`** (default) - Image fills the space while maintaining aspect ratio. May crop content.
- **`contain`** - Scales image to fit within dimensions while preserving aspect ratio. No cropping.
- **`fill`** - Stretches image to fill dimensions. May distort aspect ratio.
- **`none`** - Displays image at its original size without scaling.

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Square thumbnail with cover fit
image:
  url: "${value.raw}"
  width: 50
  height: 50
  fit: "cover"

# Wide thumbnail maintaining aspect ratio
image:
  url: "https://example.com/images/${value.raw}.jpg"
  width: 100
  # height defaults to 'auto' to maintain aspect ratio

# Original size display
image:
  url: "${value.raw}"
  fit: "none"
```

### URL Templating

The `image.url` property supports LiquidJS templating with the same tags and filters available for [dimension URLs](#urls):

**Available liquid tags:**

| Tag                                         | Description                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `${ value.formatted }`                      | The exact value of the dimension as seen in the Lightdash UI                                |
| `${ value.raw }`                            | The raw value of the dimension returned from the underlying SQL query                       |
| `${ row.table_name.column_name.formatted }` | The exact value of another column as seen in the Lightdash UI                               |
| `${ row.table_name.column_name.raw }`       | The raw value of another dimension returned from the underlying SQL query                   |

**Available liquid filters:**

You can use [liquid filters](https://liquidjs.com/filters/overview.html) to transform values:

```yaml
image:
  url: "https://example.com/${value.raw | downcase}.jpg"
```

### Current limitations

- **Dimensions only**: Image display is currently supported for dimensions and additional dimensions only (not metrics or table calculations)
- **Referenced columns**: When using `${ row.table_name.column_name }` templates, the referenced column must be included in your results table for the image to display


### Example: Product catalog with images

## Using special characters or capital letters in your column names

If you use special characters on your column names, you might get errors when using those columns on explore. For example, having a column named `Status` with capital S on a table named `orders` in postgres throws the following error:

```bash
column orders.status does not exist
```

To fix this, we can add the quoted column to our `sql` meta tag on dimensions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    - name: status
      meta:
        dimension:
          type: string
          sql: '"orders"."Status"' # you can also use '${TABLE}."Status"'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    - name: status
      config:
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
            sql: '"orders"."Status"' # you can also use '${TABLE}."Status"'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will quote the `Status` columns on the SQL query

```sql
SELECT
  "orders".order_id AS "orders_order_id",
  "orders"."Status" AS "orders_status"
FROM "postgres"."jaffle"."orders" AS "orders"
```


## Additional dimensions

Additional dimensions let you define multiple dimensions off of a single column from your dbt model. This is useful when [adding different formatting](#adding-different-formatting) to a column, [comparing or combining columns](#comparing-or-combining-columns), [parsing JSON columns](#parsing-json-columns), or creating persisted groups/buckets based off of a column.

A "normal" dimension is a column created in your .sql file in dbt that is written to your data warehouse. An additional dimension is not included in your dbt .sql file, so it's not written to your data warehouse. When used in Lightdash, it just adds the dimension definition to your SQL query (so it's "created" at runtime).

All [dimension configurations](#dimension-configuration) are available for additional dimensions. You can also [use additional dimensions when defining metrics](#using-additional-dimensions-in-metrics).

<Info>
  Additional dimensions names need to be unique in the model.

                format: '#,##0,," M"'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Comparing or combining columns

When defining additional dimensions, you can reference other dimensions, even from joined tables (`organizations` is a joined table in the example below).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: created_date
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: date
          additional_dimensions:
            days_to_first_query_run:
              type: number
              description: 'Number of days between a user being created and their first query run.'
              sql: ${first_query_date} - ${created_date}
            days_to_organization_first_payment:
              type: number
              description: 'Number of days between a user being created and their organization making its first payment. This will be negative for users who joined after the first payment.'
              sql: ${created_date} - ${organizations.first_payment_date}
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: created_date
        config:

              type: date
            additional_dimensions:
              days_to_first_query_run:
                type: number
                description: 'Number of days between a user being created and their first query run.'
                sql: ${first_query_date} - ${created_date}
              days_to_organization_first_payment:
                type: number
                description: 'Number of days between a user being created and their organization making its first payment. This will be negative for users who joined after the first payment.'
                sql: ${created_date} - ${organizations.first_payment_date}
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Parsing JSON columns

Usually you'll want to add `hidden:true` for the main JSON dimension since raw JSON is not useful in charts.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: metadata # this is a jsonb column with metadata
        meta:
          dimension:
            hidden: true
          additional_dimensions:
            version:
              type: number
              sql: JSON_VALUE(${metadata}, '$.version') # custom SQL applied to get the "version" value inside metadata
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
    ```yaml
    columns:
      - name: metadata # this is a jsonb column with metadata
        config:
          meta:
            dimension:
              hidden: true
            additional_dimensions:
              version:
                type: number
                sql: JSON_VALUE(${metadata}, '$.version') # custom SQL applied to get the "version" value inside metadata
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Adding multiple timezones for the same dimension

You can use additional dimensions to convert a timestamp into multiple timezones:




<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
  ```yaml
  columns:
    - name: created_at
      description: 'The time that the thing was created'
      meta:
        dimension:
          label: 'Created (UTC)'
          type: timestamp
        additional_dimensions:
          created_at_est:
            type: timestamp
            label: 'Created (EST)'
            description: 'The time that the thing was created, in EST'
            sql: "convert_timezone('UTC', 'America/New_York', ${TABLE}.created_at)"
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
  ```yaml
  columns:
    - name: created_at
      description: 'The time that the thing was created'
      config: 
        meta:
          dimension:
            label: 'Created (UTC)'
            type: timestamp
          additional_dimensions:
            created_at_est:
              type: timestamp
              label: 'Created (EST)'
              description: 'The time that the thing was created, in EST'
              sql: "convert_timezone('UTC', 'America/New_York', ${TABLE}.created_at)"
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>





### Using additional dimensions in metrics

To define metrics based on additional dimensions, you need to add them to the model's meta metrics, or use custom SQL in defining them under the column's meta.



<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
  ```yaml
  models:
    - name: users
      meta:
        metrics:
          highest_version_model_metric_example:
            type: max
            sql: ${version}
      columns:
        - name: metadata
          meta:
            dimension:
              hidden: true
            additional_dimensions:
              version:
                type: number
                sql: JSON_VALUE(${metadata}, '$.version')
            metrics:
              highest_version:
                type: max
                sql: ${version}
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
  ```yaml
  models:
    - name: users
      config:
        meta:
          metrics:
            highest_version_model_metric_example:
              type: max
              sql: ${version}
        columns:
          - name: metadata
            meta:
              dimension:
                hidden: true
              additional_dimensions:
                version:
                  type: number
                  sql: JSON_VALUE(${metadata}, '$.version')
              metrics:
                highest_version:
                  type: max
                  sql: ${version}
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>




### Referencing time intervals in additional dimensions

You can reference time interval dimensions within additional dimensions. This is useful for creating custom logic based on specific time intervals.

For example, you can create a tier based on whether a specific time interval has a value:



<Tabs>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.9 and earlier">
  ```yaml
    - name: session_start
      meta:
        dimension:
          type: timestamp
          time_intervals:
          - DAY_OF_WEEK_NAME
          - WEEK
          - MONTH
          - RAW
          - DAY
          - HOUR_OF_DAY_NUM
          - QUARTER
        additional_dimensions:
          extra_session_start_tier:
            type: string
            sql: |
              CASE 
                WHEN ${session_start_month} IS NOT NULL THEN 'month' 
                ELSE 'else' END
  ```  
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="dbt v1.10+">
  ```yaml
    - name: session_start
      config:
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: timestamp
            time_intervals:
            - DAY_OF_WEEK_NAME
            - WEEK
            - MONTH
            - RAW
            - DAY
            - HOUR_OF_DAY_NUM
            - QUARTER
          additional_dimensions:
            extra_session_start_tier:
              type: string
              sql: |
                CASE 
                  WHEN ${session_start_month} IS NOT NULL THEN 'month' 
                  ELSE 'else' END
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


In this example, the additional dimension `extra_session_start_tier` references `${session_start_month}`, which is the `MONTH` time interval of the `session_start` dimension.
