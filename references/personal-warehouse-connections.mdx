Personal warehouse credentials allow you to connect to your data warehouse using your own individual credentials instead of shared project credentials. This provides better security and audit trails for data access.

## When are personal warehouse credentials used?

<Info>
Personal warehouse credentials are only used for projects that require user credentials. If a project doesn't require user credentials, it will use the shared project connection instead.
</Info>

Your personal warehouse credentials will be used when:

- A project is configured to require user credentials for data access
- You're running queries, creating charts, or building dashboards in that project
- You're using the SQL runner or exploring data in projects with user credential requirements
- Scheduled deliveries are created by you (they will run using your credentials)

## Setting up personal warehouse credentials

To configure your personal warehouse credentials:

1. Navigate to your user settings by clicking on your profile in the top right corner
2. Go to the "My warehouse credentials" section
3. Enter your individual warehouse connection details
4. Save your credentials

## Supported warehouse types

- Snowflake
- BigQuery

## Security considerations

When using personal warehouse credentials:

- Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely
- Only you have access to your personal credentials
- Audit logs will show your individual user activity
- You're responsible for managing your own credential rotation and access

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- Contact your project administrator if you need help setting up your credentials

**Connection timeout or authentication errors**
- Check that your warehouse credentials are correct
- Verify your network connectivity to the warehouse
- Ensure your user account has the necessary permissions in the warehouse
