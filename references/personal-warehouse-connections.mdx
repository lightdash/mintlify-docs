Personal warehouse credentials allow you to connect to your data warehouse using your own individual credentials instead of shared project credentials. This provides better security and audit trails for data access.

## When are personal warehouse credentials used?

<Info>
    Personal warehouse credentials are only used for projects that require user
    credentials. If a project doesn't require user credentials, it will use the
    shared project connection instead.
</Info>

Your personal warehouse credentials will be used when:

-   A project is configured to require user credentials for data access
-   You're running queries, creating charts, or building dashboards in that project
-   You're using the SQL runner or exploring data in projects with user credential requirements

## Setting up personal warehouse credentials

To configure your personal warehouse credentials:

1. Navigate to your user settings by clicking on your profile in the top right corner
2. Go to the "My warehouse credentials" section
3. Enter your individual warehouse connection details
4. Save your credentials

## Supported authentication methods

Depending on your warehouse type, you can authenticate using different methods:

### Snowflake

- **Sign in with Snowflake (OAuth)**: Use your Snowflake account to authenticate via OAuth. This requires your organization to have configured a Snowflake security integration. See [Snowflake connection setup](/get-started/setup-lightdash/connect-project#sign-in-with-snowflake) for details.
- **Private Key**: Authenticate using a private key file.
- **Password**: Use your Snowflake username and password.

### Databricks

- **Sign in with Databricks (OAuth)**: Use your Databricks account to authenticate via OAuth. This requires your organization to have configured a Databricks OAuth application. See [Databricks connection setup](/get-started/setup-lightdash/connect-project#sign-in-with-databricks) for details.
- **Personal Access Token**: Use a Databricks personal access token.

### BigQuery

- **Sign in with Google (OAuth)**: Use your Google account to authenticate via OAuth.
- **Service Account**: Use a service account JSON key file.

### Other warehouses

For other warehouse types (Postgres, Redshift, Trino, ClickHouse), authentication is typically done using username and password credentials.
