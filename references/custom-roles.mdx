# Custom Roles

Custom roles allow you to create granular permission sets tailored to your organization's specific needs. With custom roles, you can define exactly which scopes (permissions) users should have, giving you fine-grained control over access to Lightdash features and resources.

## Overview

Lightdash provides two types of roles:

- **System roles**: Pre-defined roles (like Admin, Developer, Viewer) with a standard set of scopes. For more information about what these roles can do, check our permission matrix https://docs.lightdash.com/references/roles#roles-and-permissions 
- **Custom roles**: User-defined roles where you can select specific scopes to match your exact requirements

Custom roles are created at the organization level but are assigned to users or groups at the project level, allowing you to control access on a per-project basis.

<Info>

**Additive Permissions**: Lightdash uses an additive permission model. If a user already has a scope granted through their organization-level role, assigning a custom role will not restrict that access. Custom roles can only add permissions, not remove existing ones.
</Info>


## Creating Custom Roles

### Access Custom Roles Settings

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **General Settings** → **Custom Roles**
2. You'll see a list of existing custom roles in your organization

### Create a New Role from Scratch

1. Click **Create New Role**
2. Enter a **Role Name** (e.g., "Marketing Analyst", "Finance Viewer")
3. Add an optional **Description** to explain the role's purpose
4. Select the specific **scopes** (permissions) you want to include:
   - **View permissions**: Allow users to see content (dashboards, charts, spaces)
   - **Create permissions**: Allow users to create new content
   - **Manage permissions**: Allow users to edit, delete, or administer content
5. Click **Save** to create the role

### Duplicate an Existing Role

If you want to create a role similar to an existing one:

1. Find the role you want to duplicate (system role or custom role)
2. Click the **⋯** menu next to the role
3. Select **Duplicate Role**
4. Enter a new name for the duplicated role
5. Modify the scopes as needed
6. Click **Save**

This is particularly useful when you want to create a role similar to a system role but with some modifications.

## Assigning Custom Roles

Custom roles are assigned at the project level to provide granular access control:

### Assign to Users

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Access**
2. Find the user you want to assign a role to
3. Select the custom role from the dropdown
4. The user will now have the permissions defined in that custom role for this project

### Assign to Groups

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Access**
2. Find the group you want to assign a role to
3. Select the custom role from the dropdown
4. All members of the group will inherit the custom role permissions for this project

## Troubleshooting

### Users Can't See Expected Content

- Verify the custom role includes the necessary view scopes
- Check that the role is assigned at the project level where the content exists
- Remember that organization-level permissions may override custom role limitations

### Role Changes Not Taking Effect

- Users may need to refresh the page for role changes to take effect
- Verify the role was saved successfully and assigned to the correct users/groups

## Managing Existing Custom Roles

### Edit a Custom Role

1. Go to **Settings** → **General Settings** → **Custom Roles**
2. Click on the role you want to edit
3. Modify the name, description, or scopes
4. Click **Save** - changes will apply to all users and groups assigned this role

### Delete a Custom Role

1. First, ensure no users or groups are assigned this role
2. Go to **Settings** → **General Settings** → **Custom Roles**
3. Click the **trash icon** next to the role
4. Confirm the deletion

<Info>

**Deleting Roles**: Once deleted, a custom role cannot be recovered. You can't remove a role that is currently assinged to users or groups.
</Info>

Custom roles provide powerful flexibility in managing access to your Lightdash organization. By carefully designing roles that match your team's responsibilities and workflows, you can ensure users have exactly the permissions they need while maintaining security and organization.
