description: "Service accounts provide a userless alternative to Personal Access Tokens (PATs) when working with the Lightdash CLI or the API. They are created and managed at the organization level, can be assigned granular scopes, and remain valid even if the administrator who created them leaves the organization."

  Service accounts require an **Enterprise License Key**.

## Overview

Service accounts provide machine-to-machine authentication for automated access to the Lightdash API. Unlike personal access tokens which are tied to individual users, service accounts are organization-level entities designed for applications, CI/CD pipelines, and automated workflows.

Service accounts allow you to:

- Authenticate API requests without using personal user credentials
- Grant specific permission scopes (read, edit, or admin)
- Set expiration dates for tokens

## Enabling service accounts (self-hosted only)

If you're self-hosting Lightdash, you will need to add the following environment variable to your configuration:

```bash
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENABLED=true
```

After enabling, restart your Lightdash instance for the change to take effect.

## Creating a Service Account

1. Navigate to **General Settings** → **Service Accounts**
2. Click **Add Service Account**

   ![New Service Account](/images/references/workspace/new-service-account.jpg)
3. Enter a **Description** and optional **Expiry**
4. Select one or more **Scopes** to grant
5. Click **Create service account**
6. **Copy** the generated token. This is the only time it will be shown. All service account tokens will be prefixed with `ldsvc_`

## Scopes

Scopes are hierarchical - granting a higher-level scope (e.g. `org:admin`) automatically includes all lower-level permissions (e.g. `org:edit`, `org:view`).

| Scope       | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `org:view`  | Read-only access to Lightdash content.                                                                                                        |
| `org:edit`  | Can create/modify Lightdash content (charts and dashboards), **and** all `org:view` permissions.                                              |
| `org:admin` | Full organization-level control. Includes deploy, preview, download/upload, user-management, **and** all `org:edit` & `org:view` permissions. |

## Using service accounts

### With Lightdash CLI

You can use service account tokens to authenticate with the Lightdash CLI:

```bash
lightdash login https://your-lightdash-cloud --token ldsvc_your-token
```

### With the API

Service account tokens use the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ldsvc_abc123xyz..." \
  "$LIGHTDASH_URL/api/v1/..."
```

For full API documentation, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/v1/introduction).

## Example Use cases

### CI/CD automation

Use service accounts to automatically deploy dbt changes to Lightdash in your CI/CD pipeline. See [deploying with GitHub Actions](https://docs.lightdash.com/references/dbt-projects#1-automatically%3A-deploy-your-changes-to-lightdash-using-a-github-action) for implementation details.

### Instance initialization

When setting up a new self-hosted instance, configure `LD_SETUP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` to initialize with a service account. See the [environment variables guide](https://docs.lightdash.com/self-host/customize-deployment/environment-variables#initialize-instance) for details.

### Automated reporting

Use service accounts to programmatically export dashboard data, schedule reports, or integrate Lightdash data into other systems via the API.
