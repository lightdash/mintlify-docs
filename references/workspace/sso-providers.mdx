## Additional authentication options

### Password authentication

Email/password authentication is available on all plans and enabled by default. Organizations using SSO can disable password authentication to enforce SSO-only login.

### Warehouse SSO (Enterprise only)

Enterprise customers can also configure SSO for data warehouse connections:

- **Snowflake OAuth** - Users authenticate with Snowflake using their corporate identity
- **Databricks OAuth** - User-to-Machine (U2M) OAuth flow for Databricks

These create per-user warehouse credentials rather than shared project credentials.
