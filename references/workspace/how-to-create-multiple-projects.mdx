title: "Creating multiple projects"
description: With Lightdash, you can have a single organization (e.g. Lightdash), and multiple projects within that organization (e.g. Production, Jaffle Shop, etc.)

## Create a new project

<Info>
Only users with organization admin permissions can create new projects.
</Info>

To create a new project, click on `settings` \--> `project management` \--> `create new project`.

Give your project a nice, new name, then get started on setting up the dbt and warehouse connection.

## Set up the dbt + warehouse connection

You'll need to define the dbt and warehouse connections for your new project.

Not sure what it all means? Don't worry, we've written [a step-by-step guide](/get-started/setup-lightdash/connect-project) that will help you out.

## Easily switch between projects

Once you've got multiple projects set up, you can easily switch through the projects in your organization using the drop-down list in the top corner of your screen.

## Go to the project management settings to delete a project

Don't need a project anymore? That's okay - you can easily delete a project in the project settings space.
