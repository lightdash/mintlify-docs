Personal warehouse credentials allow you to connect to your data warehouse using your own individual credentials instead of shared project credentials. This provides better security and audit trails for data access.

## When are personal warehouse credentials used?

<Info>
    Personal warehouse credentials are only used for projects that require user
    credentials. If a project doesn't require user credentials, it will use the
    shared project connection instead.
</Info>

Your personal warehouse credentials will be used when:

-   A project is configured to require user credentials for data access
-   You're running queries, creating charts, or building dashboards in that project
-   You're using the SQL runner or exploring data in projects with user credential requirements

## Setting up personal warehouse credentials

To configure your personal warehouse credentials:

1. Navigate to your user settings by clicking on your profile in the top right corner
2. Go to the "My warehouse credentials" section
3. Enter your individual warehouse connection details
4. Save your credentials
