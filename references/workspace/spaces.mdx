title: "Spaces"
description: "Once you've used Lightdash for a while, your team will probably end up with a lot of saved charts and dashboards. Spaces let you organize your saved charts and dashboards."
---

Spaces are kind of like folders. All saved charts and dashboards exist in a Space and can only be in one Space at a time.

To access Spaces, you can either select a Space from the drop-down list in `Browse` or you can click on the Lightdash icon and select your Space from the homepage.

## Moving items between Spaces

To move a saved chart, dashboard or space between Spaces, you can click on the three dot menu (`...`) to the right of the item and pick the `Move` action. Or select items using checkboxes on the left and click `Move to Space`.

You can also add items to a Space from within the Space. Just click on the `Add` button on the space page.

## Updating and deleting Spaces

You can rename or delete your Space from All Spaces view or on the homescreen by clicking on the three-dot menu (`...`) for the Space.

<Warning>

Deleting a Space will delete all of the content in that Space.

## Managing access to a Space

By default, when you create a Space, it is restricted so only you can access it. You can edit a Space to make it Restricted Access or Public Access.

To edit access to a Space, navigate into the Space, then click the `share` button. From there, you can choose to make a space `Restricted Access` or `Public Access`.

</Frame>

By default, in public spaces, a user's space permissions are inherited from their project permissions. For example, if I'm a project viewer, I will get `Can View` access to a Space.

There are three space roles: `Full Access`, `Can Edit`, `Can View`

For more details about actions you can take in a Space based on your role, [check out this table](/references/workspace/roles#space-roles).

### Restricted Access Spaces

**Only admins and members that are invited to a Space with Restricted Access have access to it.**

For example, here I have a Space with Restricted Access. Only admins and the invited members have access to this Space. Katie, Filipe and Marshall have inherited `Full Access` because they are organization admins. Priyanka was invited to the space, so she has `Can View` access to the space. No one else in Lightdash can see or interact with the content in this Space unless they're invited or become an admin.

Only users with `Full Access` permissions to a Restricted Space can invite other users to that Space.

### Public Spaces

**Everyone who has access to your project has access to a Public space.**

For example, here I have a Space with Public access. Everyone who has access to my Project, "Lightdash analytics", will get access to the content in my public space.

</Frame>

**By default, you inherit your space permissions in a public space from your project permissions.**

So, if someone is an `editor` in my project, they will have `Can Edit` permissions in my Space. If someone is a `viewer` in my project, they will have `Can View` permissions in my Space. For more details about actions you can take in a Space based on your role, [check out this table](/references/workspace/roles#space-roles).

**Users with Full Access to the space can change a user's space permissions.**

In Public spaces (just like in restricted spaces), users who have `Full Access` to the space can change other users' space permissions (except admins). Users cannot be removed from Public Spaces. To make a user have `no access` to a space, you must change the space from Public to Restricted.

## Nested space permissions

Spaces can be nested inside other spaces to create a hierarchy. Nested spaces have flexible permission options that allow you to either inherit permissions from their parent or define custom access.

### Permission inheritance options

When creating or editing a space, you can choose between two access modes:

**For nested spaces** (spaces inside another space):

- **Parent Access**: The space inherits permissions from its parent space. This is the more open option—users with access to the parent automatically have the same access to the nested space. Permissions flow down through the hierarchy.
- **Custom Access**: The space has its own restricted permissions. Only users and groups explicitly invited to this space (plus admins) can access it, regardless of the parent space's access settings.

**For root-level spaces** (spaces not nested inside another space):

- **Project Access**: All project members can access the space based on their project role. This is the more open option.
- **Custom Access**: Only invited users and admins can access the space. This is the more restricted option.

### How permission inheritance works

When a nested space uses Parent Access:

1. **Inheritance chain**: Permissions flow down through the space hierarchy. If Space A contains Space B, and Space B contains Space C, then Space C can inherit permissions all the way from Space A (if both B and C use Parent Access).

2. **Breaking inheritance**: When you switch a space from Parent Access to Custom Access, the current inherited permissions are copied as direct access entries. This ensures users don't suddenly lose access when you restrict permissions.

3. **Access sources**: In the share modal, you can see where each user's access comes from:
   - **Direct access**: Explicitly granted to this space
   - **Parent space**: Inherited from a parent space
   - **Project**: Inherited from project-level permissions
   - **Organization**: Inherited from organization-level permissions

### Managing nested space permissions

To change a nested space's permission mode:

1. Navigate into the space
2. Click the `share` button
3. Toggle between Parent Access and Custom Access
4. If switching to Custom Access, you can then add or remove specific users and groups

<Note>
When you switch a space to Custom Access, you automatically receive Full Access to prevent accidentally locking yourself out.
</Note>

### Best practices for nested spaces

- **Use groups over individual users**: When sharing spaces, prefer adding groups rather than individual users. This makes permission management easier as your team grows.
- **Plan your hierarchy**: Consider how permissions should flow before creating deeply nested structures.
- **Use Parent Access when possible**: Inheriting permissions simplifies management and ensures consistent access across related content.
