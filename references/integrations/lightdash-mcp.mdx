The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) enables AI assistants (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude) and custom agents to directly interact with your Lightdash data. This integration allows MCP clients to explore your data models, search for metrics and dimensions, and provide data-driven insights - all through natural conversation. You can use MCP with existing AI assistants or integrate it into your own custom agents and automated workflows. MCP uses secure OAuth authentication and respects all your existing access controls, ensuring data remains protected.

With MCP, your AI assistant becomes a data analyst that can:

- Browse and understand your data models
- Find relevant metrics and dimensions
- Switch between different projects seamlessly
- Respect your data governance and access controls

<Info>
  MCP respects all your existing Lightdash permissions and user attributes. MCP
  clients can only access the data that your user account has permission to
  view.
