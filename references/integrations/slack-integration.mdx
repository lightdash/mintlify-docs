For walk through videos, check out our guides on [adding the Slack integration](/references/workspace/adding-slack-integration) and [using the Slack integration](/guides/using-slack-integration).

## Required permissions

The Lightdash Slack app will request permission for these scopes:

* **`[links:read]` for lightdash.cloud** : Links to lightdash.cloud will be sent to our App so we can make an internal request and fetch information from charts and dashboards so we can later share it in slack.
* **`[links:write]`** : This allows us to unfurl the URL previously mentioned.

No other content will be shared from your workspace.

## Settings

After installing the app you'll see these settings:

</Frame>

### Select a notification channel
Here you may choose a Slack channel where Lightdash will send alerts when any scheduled deliveries fail in your organization.

You must add the Lightdash app into that organization for notifications to work properly.

### Slack bot avatar

You can customize the avatar for your Lightdash slack app by adding an image URL in the Profile photo URL field. Slack recommends these images be square with a minimum of 512x512 pixels, but no larger than 1024x1024 pixels.

### AI Agents configuration

Configure how AI Agents interact with your Slack workspace. You can control whether AI Agents can access thread messages when mentioned and require OAuth authentication for AI Agent usage.

<Note>
**Slack channel limitations:** By default, each AI agent can only be connected to one Slack channel. Two agents cannot be configured in the same channel.

**Multi-agent Slack channels (Beta):** To enable multiple agents in the same Slack channel, contact Lightdash to enable this feature flag. Once enabled, you can set up a multi-agent channel where users can choose which AI agent to chat with when starting a thread.
</Note>

## Using Lightdash in private channels

Lightdash supports private Slack channels, but because Slack doesn't allow apps to see private channels by default, you'll need to manually add the Lightdash app to your private channel first.

To add Lightdash to a private channel, you can either:

- **Use the invite command** - Type `/invite @Lightdash` in the channel

</Frame>

- **Use channel settings** - Click on the channel name, go to **Integrations** > **Add an app**, then search for and add Lightdash

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/integrations/slack-integration/slack-add-app-settings.png)
</Frame>

Once the app is added, you can find the channel in Lightdash by either:

- **Refreshing the channel list** in the Lightdash UI
- **Looking up the channel by ID** - You can find your channel ID in Slack by right-clicking on the channel name, selecting "View channel details", then copying the Channel ID from the bottom of the modal.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/references/integrations/slack-integration/slack-channel-id.png)
</Frame>

In Lightdash, paste the channel ID into the Channels input field and select the "Look up channel ID" option to find your private channel.

## Unfurl Lightdash links

After installing the Slack app it will automatically unfurl links you share in Slack from your Lightdash project. The Lightdash app must be invited to a channel before it will unfurl links in that channel.

Chart and dashboard links unfurl for links copied from the URL field and also "share" links copied by clicking the link icon.

<Note>
When generating link previews, queries are executed using the credentials of the user who installed the Slack app. This means the preview will reflect that user's data access permissions, not the permissions of the person sharing the link. If the installer's warehouse session expires, link previews will fail until they re-authenticate.
</Note>

Here's what an individual chart looks like unfurled:

And an unfurled dashboard:

</Frame>

## Scheduled deliveries

Once Slack is added to your Lightdash organization you can use it as a destination for scheduled deliveries. You can schedule refreshes for either Charts or Dashboards and push the results into a Slack channel or DM.

The result will look like this for charts if you choose to attach an image of the chart:

</Frame>
And like this for dashboards if you chose _not_ to include an image:

</Frame>

## Saved Chart Alerts in Slack

In addition to scheduled deliveries, you can also set up [alerts on saved charts](/guides/how-to-create-alerts) that only send to slack if certain criteria are met.

## AI analyst agents

The Slack integration is also used by AI analyst agents to chat with your data and build charts in Slack. Once you have access to AI analysts you can give them access to Slack threads in your integration settings.

To trigger AI responses, mention the Lightdash app in your message. There's only one Lightdash Slack app name to mention - you don't need to specify a particular agent. Lightdash automatically routes your question to the most appropriate agent. If it's unclear which agent should respond, you'll be prompted to choose.
