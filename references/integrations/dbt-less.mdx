## What is dbt-less Lightdash?

dbt-less Lightdash allows you to use Lightdash without an existing dbt project. Instead of defining your semantic layer within dbt model YAML files, you define it directly in standalone YAML files that point to tables in your data warehouse.

This approach lets you leverage Lightdash's powerful features—like the semantic layer, AI agents, and self-service analytics—without needing to adopt dbt first.

## Why use dbt-less Lightdash?

Lightdash has always operated with dbt at its core. Traditionally, customers have active dbt projects, and Lightdash builds its semantic layer within that dbt context.

However, not every team uses dbt. If you're interested in Lightdash features like:

- **AI agents** that can answer questions about your data
- **A semantic layer** with consistent metric definitions
- **Self-service analytics** for your business users

...but you don't have dbt set up, dbt-less Lightdash provides a path forward. You can define your semantic layer directly and start using Lightdash immediately, without the overhead of adopting dbt.

<Info>
dbt is open source, so using dbt-less Lightdash isn't about avoiding a paid solution—it's about meeting you where you are in your data stack journey.

## dbt vs dbt-less: which should you use?

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| You already have a dbt project | Use the standard [dbt integration](/references/integrations/dbt-projects) |
| You're planning to adopt dbt soon | Consider setting up dbt first, then connecting to Lightdash |
| You don't use dbt and want to try Lightdash quickly | Use dbt-less Lightdash |
| You want AI agents or semantic layer features without dbt | Use dbt-less Lightdash |
| You have tables in your warehouse ready to explore | Use dbt-less Lightdash |

The good news: if you start with dbt-less Lightdash and later decide to adopt dbt, the YAML format is similar enough that migration is straightforward.

## Getting started with dbt-less Lightdash

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. The [Lightdash CLI installed](/guides/cli/how-to-install-the-lightdash-cli)
2. [Authenticated with Lightdash](/guides/cli/cli-authentication)
3. Credentials for your data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake)
4. Tables in your warehouse that you want to explore

### Step 1: Create your first model

Create a directory structure for your Lightdash project:

```bash
mkdir -p lightdash/models
```

Create a YAML file for your first model. For example, `./lightdash/models/users.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: users
    meta:
      sql_from: my_database.my_schema.users  # Update this to your table name
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
      - name: email
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
      - name: created_at
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: timestamp
      - name: user_id
        meta:
          metrics:
            total_users:
              type: count_distinct
```

Update the configuration:

- Set `sql_from` to the fully qualified name of your table (e.g., `database.schema.table`)
- Update the dimensions to match the columns in your table
- Add metrics that make sense for your data

### Step 2: Validate your YAML

Check your YAML files for errors by running:

```bash
lightdash lint
```

This command validates your configuration and reports any issues before you deploy.

### Step 3: Deploy your project

Create your Lightdash project by deploying with the CLI:

```bash
lightdash deploy --create --no-warehouse-credentials
```

The `--no-warehouse-credentials` flag tells Lightdash that you're using dbt-less mode and will configure warehouse credentials separately in the Lightdash UI.

### Step 4: Update your project

After your initial deployment, you can edit your `.yml` files and redeploy changes:

```bash
lightdash deploy --no-warehouse-credentials
```

## Developing with AI copilots

If you're developing with Cursor, Claude Code, Kilo Code, or another AI copilot, you can speed up your workflow significantly.

### Recommended setup

1. **Provide the schema reference:** Give your copilot this link to the Lightdash YAML format specification:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightdash/lightdash/refs/heads/main/packages/common/src/schemas/json/model-as-code-1.0.json
   ```

2. **Use validation:** Prompt your copilot to always run `lightdash lint` after making any changes to catch errors early.

3. **Share your warehouse schema:** Give your copilot access to your warehouse schema. This makes it very fast to generate YAML files that match your actual table structures.

<Tip>
With access to your warehouse schema, AI copilots can auto-generate dimension and metric definitions for entire tables in seconds.

## Next steps

Once you've deployed your dbt-less project:

- [Explore your data](/get-started/exploring-data/using-explores) in the Lightdash UI
- [Create metrics](/get-started/develop-in-lightdash/how-to-create-metrics) to define your key business calculations
- [Set up AI agents](/guides/ai-agents) to enable natural language queries
- Learn about the [semantic layer reference](/references/metrics) for advanced configuration options
