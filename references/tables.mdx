Tables in Lightdash are built from dbt models (either one, or many joined together).

## Adding Tables to your project

Tables come from dbt models that have been defined in your dbt project's `schema.yml` files.

If your dbt model has been defined in a YAML file, and has at least one column documented, it will appear in Lightdash as a table.

For example, if we had this in our `schema.yml` files in dbt, we'd see a Table called **Users** in Lightdash.

```yaml
models:
  - name: users
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: "The unique identified for each user"
```

You can read more about [adding Tables to Lightdash here](/guides/adding-tables-to-lightdash).

## Table configuration

You can customize how Tables look in Lightdash by adding configuration to your YAML file. Here's an example of most the properties you can use when defining a Table:

```yaml
models:
  - name: users
    meta:
      label: 'App Users'
      order_fields_by: 'label'
      group_label: 'Mobile App'
      sql_filter: ${date_dimension} >= '2025-01-01'
      primary_key: user_id
      sets:
  	    event_fields: 
    	  fields:
            - user_id
            - event_type
      joins:
        - join: events
          sql_on: ${users.user_id} = ${events.user_id}
          fields: [event_fields*]
          relationship: one-to-many
      required_attributes:
        product_team: 'Mobile'
      explores:
        users_pii:
          required_attributes:
            has_pii_access: true 
          joins: 
            - join: users_pii
              sql_on: ${users.user_id} = ${users_pii.user_id}
              relationship: one-to-one
```

### Adding a new dbt model

If you've added a new dbt model to your project, you need to do `dbt run` + `dbt refresh` before it will appear in Lightdash.

Lightdash gets information about your data models from dbt. But it gets information about the data **_generated_** by those data models from your data warehouse.

This means that if you add a new dbt model to your project or update a model so that you're making changes to the table it generates, then you need to do two things before your changes will appear in Lightdash:

1. **Materialize the new table or changes using dbt run.** You want the data in your data warehouse to be the new table you're expecting. So you need to do `dbt run` to update the table from the data model you just changed.
2. **`Click Refresh dbt in Lightdash or run lightdash refresh in the CLI.`** This will re-sync your dbt project in Lightdash so that changes you made to your dbt models are shown in Lightdash (e.g. adding a new table or column).

### Order fields by

By default, the fields in your sidebar for any table will appear alphabetically (`order_fields_by: "label"`). Sometimes, you might not want your fields to appear alphabetically, but instead, in the same order as they are in your YAML file. You can achieve this by setting the `order_fields_by` parameter in your table's meta tag to `index`, like this:

```yaml
models:
  - name: users
    meta:
      order_fields_by: 'index'
    columns:
      - name: user_id
      - name: user_name
      - name: user_email
```

So, in the example above, the fields in the sidebar for "My Table" would appear in the order:

- user_id
- user_name
- user_email

Instead of being listed alphabetically.

Here are some other things worth mentioning about the `order_fields_by` parameter:

- By default, `order_fields_by` is set to `label`, which means that your fields will appear in the table listed alphabetically.
- Since metrics can be declared in multiple places within your YAML (as a dbt metric, in the model `meta` tag, under a dimension's `meta`), we force the following order on metrics if you set `order_fields_by` to `index`:
  - dbt metrics appear first
  - then, metrics defined in the model's `meta`
  - then, metrics defined in the dimensions' `meta`
- Group labels inherit the index of the first dimension that use them.

### Group label

If you set this property, the table will be grouped in the sidebar with other tables with the same group label.

The tables in your sidebar will appear in the following order:

- Group labels appear first, alphabetically
- Ungrouped tables appear after the grouped tables in the sidebar, alphabetically
- Tables within the groups are also ordered alphabetically

</Frame>

### SQL from

`sql_from` is a configuration option that **overrides the default dbt model relation name** when generating SQL queries in Lightdash.

For example, you might use this if you want your Lightdash explore to query from a specific materialized view, a different schema, or include additional SQL logic in the FROM clause while still maintaining the dbt model structure for dimensions and metrics.

```yaml
models:
  - name: sales
    meta:
      sql_from: my_schema.my_sales_view
```

### SQL filter (row-level security)

`sql_filter` adds a filter to the table that cannot be removed in Lightdash. It is automatically added to the compiled SQL when running queries.

For example:

```yaml
models:
  - name: sales
    meta:
      sql_filter: ${TABLE}.sales_region = 'EMEA'
```

Any queries that I run using the `Sales` table in Lightdash will always have a filter for `sales_region = 'EMEA'` in their compiled SQL

```yaml
select [...]
from lightdash.prod.sales
where sales_region = 'EMEA'
```

##### Row-level security using user attributes

Using `sql_filter` with [user attributes](/references/user-attributes) allows you to set up [row-level security in your tables](/references/user-attributes#row-filtering-with-sql%5Ffilter). You can reference user attributes in your `sql_filter` using `${lightdash.attributes.my_attribute_name}`

For example:

```yaml
models:
  - name: sales
    meta:
      sql_filter: ${TABLE}.sales_region IN (${lightdash.attributes.sales_region})
```

##### `sql_filter` will only be applied when querying tables directly.

For example:

- Table A is joined to Table B
- Table B has a `sql_filter` applied to it
- A user queries Table A and adds a field from the joined table (Table B) to their query
- the `sql_filter` from Table B will **not** be applied to the query (you would need to add this as a `sql_filter` to Table A directly for it to apply)

##### If you reference a dimension from a joined table in your `sql_filter`, the referenced table will always be joined in your queries.

For example:

- You have Table A which is joined to Table B
- In Table A, you've added a `sql_filter: ${TABLE}.sales_region = 'EMEA' OR ${table_b}.sales_region IS NULL`
- Table B will always be joined to Table A in your queries (even if there are no fields from Table B selected in your results table)

### Required attributes

Lightdash can use [user attributes](/references/user-attributes) to limit some tables to some users.

In the example below, only users with `is_admin` attribute `true` can use the `payments` table. Users without access to this table will not see it on the `tables page` or the `explore page` when joined to other tables.

```yaml
models:
  - name: payments
    meta:
      required_attributes:
        is_admin: "true"
```

If a user without access to this table runs a query that contains this table, they will get a `Forbidden` error.

## Default filters

Use `default_filters` to define filters on Dimensions that will be applied when no other user-defined filter on those Dimensions exists. Default filters will show apply to tables on load and can be populated with a pre-determined value. User them to suggest to users the kind of filters they might want to consider, or provide a default filtered view of a table that can be changed if needed.

An optional `required` flag can be added - in which case the filter _cannot_ be removed. This can be particulalry useful if you have a large table and want to force users to filter on a partitioned date.

Below you can see there is a default filter with the optional required flag, that will have show the last 14 days of data by default.

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    meta:
      default_filters:
        - date: 'inThePast 14 days'
		  required: true
    columns:
      - name: date
        description: 'Order date'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: date
```

<Info>
  A _required_ filter's field reference can't be changed, but its operator (is, is not, etc.) and value can be changed when querying the table from the UI.
</Info>

### If you have many filters in your list, they will be joined using `AND`

```yaml
  - name: orders
    meta:
      default_filters:
        - date: 'inThePast 14 days'
        - status: "completed"
    columns:
      - name: date
        description: 'Order date'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: date
      - name: status
        description: 'Order status - completed, pending, cancelled'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
```

In the example above, the `orders` table will have a default filter of `date` in the past 14 days **and** `status` completed. Both can be removed by the user, as the `required` flag is not present.

Note that we do also support a _legacy_ structure for defining required filters, see below:

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    meta:
      required_filters:
        - date: 'inThePast 14 days'
    columns:
      - name: date
        description: 'Order date'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: date
```

## Defining primary keys

You can specify a primary key for your model to uniquely identify each row. This is important for tables as it helps Lightdash understand the relationships between tables and prevent data duplication, especially when dealing with SQL fanouts in joins.

The primary key can be defined in two ways:

### Single column primary key

If your table has a single column that uniquely identifies each row, you can define it as a string:

```yaml
models:
  - name: users
    meta:
      primary_key: user_id
```

### Complex primary key

If your table requires multiple columns to uniquely identify each row, you can define the primary key as an array of strings:

```yaml
models:
  - name: order_items
    meta:
      primary_key: [order_id, item_id]
```

Using a properly defined primary key helps Lightdash optimize queries and provide accurate results when working with joined tables. It's especially important for preventing metric inflation in SQL joins where duplicate rows can lead to incorrect aggregations.

## Available filter types

| Type                          | Example (in English)                           | Example (as code)           |

| is not                        | User name is not equal to katie                | user_name: "!katie"         |
| contains                      | User name contains katie                       | user_name: "%katie%"        |

| is null                       | Status is NULL                                 | status: "null"              |
| is not null                   | Status is not NULL                             | status: "!null"             |
| is [boolean]                  | Is complete is true                            | is_complete: "true"         |
| is not [boolean]              | Is complete is false or null                   | is_complete: "!true"        |

## Parameters configuration

The `parameters` section allows you to define model-level parameters that can be referenced in various parts of your model's SQL properties. These parameters are scoped to the specific model where they're defined.

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    meta:
      parameters:
        region:
          label: "Region"
          description: "Filter data by region"
          options:
            - "EMEA"
            - "AMER"
            - "APAC"
          default: ["EMEA", "AMER"]
          multiple: true
        min_order_value:
          label: "Minimum Order Value"
          description: "Filter for minimum order value"
          type: "number"
          options:
            - 100
            - 500
            - 1000
          default: 500
        department:
          label: "Department"
          description: "Filter data by department"
          options_from_dimension:
            model: "employees"
            dimension: "department"
```

Each parameter is defined as a key-value pair where the key is the parameter name (must be alphanumeric with underscores or hyphens) and the value is an object with the following properties:

| Property                 | Required | Value                                       | Description                                                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`                  | Yes      | string                                      | A user-friendly label for the parameter as it will be displayed in the UI.                                 |
| `description`            | No       | string                                      | A description of the parameter.                                                                            |
| `type`                   | No       | "string" or "number"                        | The type of the parameter. Defaults to "string" if not specified.                                          |
| `options`                | No       | Array of strings or numbers                 | A list of possible values for the parameter.                                                               |
| `default`                | No       | string, number, or Array of strings/numbers | The default value(s) for the parameter.                                                                    |
| `multiple`               | No       | boolean                                     | Whether the parameter input will be a multi-select.                                                        |
| `allow_custom_values`    | No       | boolean                                     | Whether users can input custom values beyond predefined options.                                           |
| `options_from_dimension` | No       | Object                                      | Get parameter options from a dimension in a model. Requires `model` and `dimension` arguments (see below). |

If using `options_from_dimension`, the object requires the following properties:

| Property    | Required | Value  | Description                         |
| :---------- | :------- | :----- | :---------------------------------- |
| `model`     | Yes      | string | The model containing the dimension. |
| `dimension` | Yes      | string | The dimension to get options from.  |

### Using model-level parameters

Model-level parameters are referenced with the model name included in the syntax: `${lightdash.parameters.model_name.parameter_name}` or the shorter alias `${ld.parameters.model_name.parameter_name}`.

For example, to reference a parameter named `region` from the current model:

```yaml
${lightdash.parameters.orders.region}
```

Or using the shorter alias:

```yaml
${ld.parameters.orders.region}
```

#### Using parameters from joined tables

You can also reference model-level parameters from joined tables. This is particularly useful when you want to use parameters defined in one model while working in another:

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: customers
          sql_on: |
            ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.customer_id}
            AND ${customers.status} = ${ld.parameters.customers.customer_status}
```

In this example, the join condition references a model-level parameter `customer_status` that is defined in the `customers` model, even though we're configuring the `orders` model.

See the [Parameters guide](/guides/using-parameters) for more examples and information on how to use parameters.

## Explores

You can define multiple table explores from a single table using the `explores` config. This will allow you to list the same dbt model multiple times in the list of Tables in Lightdash. You can use it to show different versions of a table, join different tables to the base table, customize table visibility, etc.

Below is an advanced example of using Explores. This will result in three total tables using the `deals` model at the base.

- **Deals** will not have any joins or limitations
- **Deals w/Accounts** will join to the `accounts` table and show all Accounts fields, but only people with the `is_exec` user attribute can see it
- **Deals w/Accounts (no Names)** will join to the `accounts` table and only show Industry and Segment dimensions, it has no access restrictions

```yaml
models:
- name: deals
  meta:
    primary_key: deal_id
    explores:
      deals_accounts:
        required_attributes:
          is_exec: "true"
        label: 'Deals w/Accounts'
        description: The deals table with the Accounts table details included
        joins:
        - join: accounts
          relationship: many-to-one
          sql_on: ${deals.account_id} = ${accounts.account_id}
      deals_accounts_no_names:
        label: 'Deals w/Accounts (no Names)'
        description: The deals table with the Accounts table details included
        joins:
        - join: accounts
          relationship: many-to-one
          sql_on: ${deals.account_id} = ${accounts.account_id}
          fields: [industry, segment, unique_accounts, unique_smb_accounts, unique_midmarket_accounts, unique_enterprise_accounts]
```

All the [table configuration options](#table-configuration) can be used under the `explores` tag.

## Sets

Sometimes you may find that you're redeclaring the same set of fields for things like joins and show_underlying_values. In this case, you can define a `set`.  A `set` allows you to associate those fields to a single value. That reference can then be used any place you would normally define fields.

```yaml
# Define a set
sets: 
  my_set:
    - user_id
    - user_name
    - created_at

# Referencing the set
fields: [my_set*]

# Lightdash resolves to
fields: [user_id, user_name, created_at]
```

### Expand

The expand operator (ex. `my_set*`) tells Lightdash to look up the set being referenced and resolve it to the associated collection of fields. When Lightdash compiles your model, it will replace set reference names with the actual fields.

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders_model
    meta:
      sets:
        my_user_fields:
          fields:
            - user_id
            - user_name
    columns:
      - name: revenue
        meta:
          metrics:
            sum_revenue:
              type: sum
              show_underlying_values:
                - my_user_fields* # Reference to the set we defined
```

### Exclusions

In the instance where you want to leverage some, but not all fields in a `set`, you can use the excludes operator (ex. `-field_name`). The exclusion needs to be used in conjunction with an expand operator. This tells Lightdash to expand a given `set` while omitting any field name using the exclusion operator.

```yaml
models:
  - name: orders_model
    meta:
      sets:
        my_user_fields:
          fields:
            - user_id
            - user_name
    columns:
      - name: revenue
        meta:
          metrics:
            sum_revenue:
              type: sum
              show_underlying_values:
                - my_user_fields* 
                - -user_id # Expand `my_user_fields` and exclude `user_id`
```

### Joins

Within a model, you may join with other model tables. The sets you define can reference those joined fields as well! Use dot notation to reference a joined table:

```yaml
models:
  - name: purchases
    columns: <...>
    meta:
      sets:
  	    revenue_fields: 
    	  fields:
            - purchase_date
            - purchase_amount
            - user.user_name # Referencing the joined table
      joins:
        - join: user
          sql_on: ${users.user_id} = ${purchases.user_id}
          relationship: one-to-many
      metrics: 
        revenue:
          type: sum
          show_underlying_values:
            - revenue_fields*
```

Remember, to use a fields from another table in your set, you need ensure it is joined with the model defining the `set`.
