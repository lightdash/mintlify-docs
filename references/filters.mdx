## Using filters

To learn more about using filters, check out our docs on limiting data using filters.

## Filter types

### Numeric filters

| Filter          | logic                                                                                                 |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| is null         | Only pulls in rows where the values are null for the field selected.                                  |
| is not null     | Only pulls in rows where the values are not null for the field selected.                              |
| is              | Only pulls in rows where the values are equal to the values listed.                                   |
| is not          | Only pulls in rows where the values are not equal to the values listed.                               |
| is less than    | Only pulls in rows where the values for the field selected are strictly less than the value listed.   |
| is greater than | Only pulls in rows where the values for the field selectedare strictly greater than the value listed. |

### String filters

| Filter      | logic                                                                                              |

## Date/Timestamp Filter Reference Guide

The below examples show possible date/timestamp filter combinations and their corresponding SQL outputs. All examples use BigQuery syntax and assume:
- Current timestamp: `2025-10-24 15:30:00`
- Example field: `orders.created_at`
- Timezone: UTC
- Week starts on Monday

#### Notes

1. **Completed periods** always:
   - Start at the beginning of a period (00:00:00)
   - End at the beginning of the next period
   - Don't include partial periods

2. **Rolling periods** (non-completed):
   - Use the current time as the reference point
   - Look backward/forward the specified amount
   - Include partial periods

3. **Current periods**:
   - Always start at the beginning of the current period
   - End at the beginning of the next period
   - Example: Current month starts at 1st of the month

4. **Week handling**:
   - By default, weeks start on the default day configured in your database
   - You can configure this to a different day in your database connection settings
   - Week boundaries are always at midnight (00:00:00)

| Between 2 dates | `orders.created_date >= DATE('2025-10-01') AND orders.created_date <= DATE('2025-10-31')` |
| On exact date | `orders.created_date = DATE('2025-10-24')` |

#### Notes

1. **Key differences from timestamp filters**:
   - No time components in any filters
   - Single day comparisons use equality (`=`) instead of ranges
   - `DATE()` function used instead of `TIMESTAMP()`

2. **Completed periods** always:
   - Start at the beginning of a period
   - End at the beginning of the next period
   - Don't include partial periods
   - For single days, use equality instead of ranges

3. **Rolling periods**:
   - Use the current date as the reference point
   - Count in full days (N days forward/backward)
   - Include the current date in the range

4. **Current periods**:
   - For single day: use equality
   - For longer periods: use standard ranges
   - Example: Current month is all days from 1st to last day

5. **Week handling**:
   - Weeks start on Monday by default
   - Can be configured to start on Sunday
   - Full days only, no time components
