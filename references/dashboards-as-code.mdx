title: "Dashboards as code"
description: "You can download your charts and dashboards as code, make changes, then upload your changes back to your Lightdash project using the CLI. Content as code is also useful for creating new Lightdash projects where you want the content to be copied from an existing project and added to your new project."
---

## `lightdash download`

From the [Lightdash CLI](/references/lightdash-cli), you can use the command `lightdash download` to download all of the charts and dashboards from your Lightdash project as code. All of the charts and dashboards will be written as .yml files to a `lightdash` directory wherever you're running the command.

E.g. if you're running this command inside your dbt directory (eg: `/home/javi/dbt`) then it will create a folder (`/home/javi/dbt/lightdash`). If you're running this command in `/home/javi/documents` it will create the folder in `/home/javi/documents/lightdash`.

</Frame>

##### Running `lightdash download` will overwrite any changes you have locally

For example:

- I run `lightdash download` and one of the charts that is downloaded is `emea-revenue-per-month.yml`
- I make some changes to the `emea-revenue-per-month.yml` file and save them
- I **do not** upload my changes, they are just saved locally
- I run `lightdash download` again
- The changes I made to `emea-revenue-per-month.yml` will be overwritten by the latest chart version downloaded from the Lightdash application

### Select specific items to download

##### Use `lightdash download -c` or `lightdash download --charts` to select specific charts

If you only want to download specific charts to manage as code, you can use the chart selector in the download command.

For example, if I only wanted to download a specific saved chart as code, I would run the command:

```bash
lightdash download -c https://app.lightdash.cloud/the-url-to-my-saved-chart
```

You can use the chart's SLUG, UUID, or the URL to the saved chart to select the chart.

##### Use `lightdash download -d` or `lightdash download --dashboards` to select specific dashboards

This will download the dashboard and all of the charts in the dashboard as code. For example, if I only wanted to download a specific dashboard as code, I would run the command:

```bash
lightdash download -d https://app.lightdash.cloud/the-url-to-my-dashboard
```

You can use the dashboard's SLUG, UUID, or the URL to the dashboard to select the dashboard.

##### To select multiple charts or dashboards, add a space between the items.

For example, this command would select two charts to download:

```bash
lightdash download -c https://app.lightdash.cloud/the-url-to-my-first-saved-chart https://app.lightdash.cloud/the-url-to-my-second-saved-chart
```

You can combine charts and dashboards selection in a single command. For example, this command would download a chart and a dashboard:

```bash
lightdash download -c https://app.lightdash.cloud/the-url-to-my-first-saved-chart -d https://app.lightdash.cloud/the-url-to-my-dashboard
```

### Specify a download path

Use `lightdash download -p` or `lightdash download --path` to specify a directory to download to

By default, `lightdash download` will create a new `lightdash` directory in your current working directory and write the content there. You can customize the directory that you write to using `lightdash download -p`. For example:

```bash
lightdash download -p /Users/katiehindson/lightdash/lightdash-analytics/
```

This will create: `/Users/katiehindson/lightdash/lightdash-analytics/charts/` and `/Users/katiehindson/lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dashboards` and save the content to these new folders.

You can also use relative paths like:

```bash
lightdash download -p ../
```

### Download an entire project

Use `lightdash download --project <project UUID>` to download all content from a specific project

Running `lightdash download` will download all content from your current set project (set using `lightdash config set-project`). But, you can download content from another project using `lightdash download --project my-project-uuid`. For example:

```bash
lightdash download --project 21eef0b9-5bae-40f3-851e-9554588e71a6
```

You can find a project's UUID from your Lightdash URL. For example, `https://app.lightdash.cloud/projects/123-project-uuid/`. Here, the project UUID here is `123-project-uuid` .

## `lightdash upload`

`lightdash upload` updates any content as code to your project.

From the [Lightdash CLI](/references/lightdash-cli), you can use the command `lightdash upload` to upload any changes you've made to your charts or dashboards as code. To upload new charts that you've created as code to your Lightdash project, you need to run `lightdash upload --force`

### Select specific items to upload

##### Use `lightdash upload -c` or `lightdash upload --charts` to select specific charts

For example, if I only wanted to upload a specific saved chart as code, I would run the command:

```bash
lightdash upload -c my-saved-chart-slug
```

You must specify the chart using the chart's SLUG.

##### Use `lightdash upload -d` or `lightdash upload --dashboards` to select specific dashboards

For example, if I only wanted to upload a specific dashboard as code, I would run the command:

```bash
lightdash upload -d my-dashboard-slug
```

You must specify the dashboard using the dashboard's SLUG.

##### Use `--include-charts` to upload chart changes when uploading dashboards

When uploading specific dashboards using `-d`, you can also include any chart changes referenced by those dashboards by adding the `--include-charts` flag:

```bash
lightdash upload -d my-dashboard-slug --include-charts
```

This automatically includes charts that are referenced in the dashboard tiles, ensuring that both dashboard and chart changes are uploaded together.

##### To select multiple charts or dashboards, add a space between the items

For example, this command would select two charts to upload:

```bash
lightdash upload -c my-saved-chart-1-slug my-saved-chart-2-slug
```

### Specify a path to upload from.

Use `lightdash upload -p` or `lightdash upload --path` to specify a directory to upload from.

By default, `lightdash upload` will upload all items you have saved in the `lightdash` directory in your current working directory. You can customize the directory that you upload from using `lightdash upload -p`. For example:

```bash
lightdash upload -p /Users/katiehindson/lightdash/lightdash-analytics/
```

This will upload all content from: `/Users/katiehindson/lightdash/lightdash-analytics/charts/` and `/Users/katiehindson/lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dashboards`.

You can also use relative paths like:

```bash
lightdash download -p ../
```

### Specify a project to upload to

Use `lightdash upload --project <project UUID>` to upload your content to a specific project.

Running `lightdash upload` will upload all content to your current set project (set using `lightdash config set-project`). But, you can upload content to another project using `lightdash upload --project my-project-uuid`. For example:

```bash
lightdash upload --project 21eef0b9-5bae-40f3-851e-9554588e71a6
```

You can find a project's UUID from your Lightdash URL. For example, `https://app.lightdash.cloud/projects/123-project-uuid/`. Here, the project UUID here is `123-project-uuid` .

##### Only content as code that you've made changes to will be uploaded

For example:

- I have a chart that I've downloaded as code called `total-sales-worldwide.yml` in my `lightdash/` directory
- I only make changes to that chart's .yml
- I run `lightdash upload`
- `total-sales-worldwide.yml` is the only file that gets uploaded because it's the only file that I made changes to

For example:

- Katie has a chart that she's downloaded as code called `total-sales-worldwide.yml` in her `lightdash/` directory
- She doesn't make any changes to the chart as code
- Javi opens the same chart, `Total sales worldwide`, in the Lightdash application, makes some changes, and saves them
- Now, Katie's `total-sales-worldwide.yml` and the `Total sales worldwide` chart in the application are different.
- Katie runs `lightdash upload`
- Katie's `total-sales-worldwide.yml` does **not** get uploaded because she made no changes to the chart as code
- Javi's changes to the `Total sales worldwide` chart that he made in the Lightdash application are **not** overwritten (the version he created is what we see in the Lightdash application)

##### Content that's been downloaded as code can still be updated in the Lightdash application

For example:

- There is a Lightdash project called `Stellar Marketing`
- Priyanka runs `lightdash download` and downloads all of the project's content as code, including a chart called `Total new clients`
- Jake opens the `Total new clients` chart in the Lightdash application and makes some changes
- Priyanka doesn't run `lightdash download`, so the `total-new-clients.yml` chart that Priyanka has as code is the old version of the chart, before Jake updated it.
- Priyanka makes changes to `total-new-clients.yml` then runs `lightdash upload` and uploads her changes and overwrites the changes that Jake made in the Lightdash application.
- Both Jake and Priyanka can update the same chart as code, or in the Lightdash application.

## Lightdash content templates

You can use the `lightdash download` and `lightdash upload` commands to easily build templates for Lightdash content and reuse these templates to build new or update existing projects.

### Creating a new Lightdash project from a Lightdash template

If you're creating many dbt projects with similar models and want to easily spin up new versions of these projects, but with different table, field, or chart names, then you can use content as code to create a Lightdash template of your project to reuse.

To do this, you'll need to:

- Take your existing Lightdash project with all of the content that you want to copy.
- In the CLI, run `lightdash download` to download all of the content as code from the project
- Navigate to your new dbt project that you want to connect to Lightdash.
- Copy-paste over the `lightdash/` directory inside your new dbt project with all of the content as code from your template project (or, only copy over the content that you want to use in your new project)
- Once you're happy with your content, you're going to run `lightdash config set-project` and select your new Lightdash project from the list of projects
- Then, you'll run `lightdash upload --force` to upload all of the content as code you've added in your `lightdash/` directory to your new Lightdash project

### Adding content to an existing project from a Lightdash template

Sometimes, if you're managing multiple dbt projects with similar models, you want to be able to easily create and manage the same charts and dashboards across all of the projects at the same time. You can do this with content as code to create a Lightdash template project.

- You want to create a Lightdash project that only contains all of the content that you want to share across your projects
- From your CLI, you can run `lightdash download` to download all of this content as code
- You can then copy-paste the .yml files that get written across to any of the other dbt projects you have where you want to reuse the same charts and dashboards.
- Once you've copied over any content that you wanted to manage across projects, from the CLI, you should run `lightdash config set-project` and select the project where you've added these new charts/dashboards as code to.
- Then, you should run `lightdash upload` to upload all of the new content as code.

### Using community templates

Alongside making templates from your own project, you can also use templates from the [lightdash-templates](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash-templates) repo to quickly build dashboards on top of common datasets.

For example, if you are using BigQuery as your data warehouse, you can use the community templates to build a usage tracking dashboard in a matter of minutes.

There are detailed instructions within the repo, but the general steps are as follows:

- Identify the content you wish to implement, and navigate to the relevant folder.
- Copy the content from the `Lightdash` folder into your dbt project.
- Run `lightdash upload --force` to push your new content to Lightdash.

Note that these templates still rely on access to an underlying dbt model containing the relevant data, you might need to create or adjust this following the instructions in the [lightdash-templates](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash-templates) repo.

## yml reference

This section provides a comprehensive reference of all possible configurations for Charts and Dashboards defined as YAML/JSON. The best way to start is often to create your content in the Lightdash UI, download it, and examine the structure. Below you'll find detailed documentation of all available properties and configurations.

Custom dimensions allow you to create new dimensions on-the-fly, either by binning existing dimensions or writing custom SQL.

**Types:**

- `bin` - Create bins/ranges from an existing dimension
- `sql` - Write custom SQL to create a dimension

**Bin Dimension (Binning):**

```yaml
metricQuery:
  customDimensions:
    - id: "amount_range"
      name: "Amount Range"
      type: "bin"
      table: "payments"
      dimensionId: "payments_amount"
      binType: "fixed_number" # Options: fixed_number, fixed_width, custom_range
      binNumber: 5 # For fixed_number: number of bins to create
      # binWidth: 1000  # For fixed_width: width of each bin
      # customRange:     # For custom_range: explicit ranges
      #   - from: undefined
      #     to: 100
      #   - from: 100
      #     to: 500
      #   - from: 500
      #     to: undefined
```

**Bin Types:**

- `fixed_number` - Split data into N equal bins (uses `binNumber`)
- `fixed_width` - Create bins of fixed width (uses `binWidth`)
- `custom_range` - Define custom bin ranges (uses `customRange`)

**SQL Dimension (Custom SQL):**

```yaml
metricQuery:
  customDimensions:
    - id: "custom_category"
      name: "Custom Category"
      type: "sql"
      table: "orders"
      sql: 'CASE WHEN ${orders.revenue} > 1000 THEN "High" ELSE "Low" END'
      dimensionType: "string" # Options: string, number, timestamp, date, boolean
```

## Important Notes

1. **UUIDs:** Most UUIDs are optional and auto-generated if not provided
2. **Readonly Fields:** `updatedAt` and `downloadedAt` are system-managed
3. **Slug Validation:** All slugs are validated against the pattern `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
4. **Grid System:** Dashboard tiles use a 24-column grid system
5. **Default Tile Size:** Charts default to `{h: 9, w: 15}`, big numbers to `{h: 6, w: 9}`
6. **Filter Inheritance:** Dashboard filters can be disabled or remapped per tile
7. **Schema Validation:** Both YAML and JSON formats validate against JSON Schema

## JSON schema validation in VSCode

When building content as code in YAML format, you can enable JSON schema validation in VSCode to get autocomplete suggestions and validation. This helps you understand what properties are supported and ensures your YAML files are correctly formatted.

To set this up:

1. Install the [YAML extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

2. Open your VSCode user settings in JSON format (press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)")

3. Add the following configuration:

```json VSCode settings.json [expandable]
"[yaml]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "redhat.vscode-yaml"
},
"yaml.schemas": {
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightdash/lightdash/refs/heads/main/packages/common/src/schemas/json/chart-as-code-1.0.json": [
    "path_to_charts/charts/*.yml"
  ],
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightdash/lightdash/refs/heads/main/packages/common/src/schemas/json/dashboard-as-code-1.0.json": [
    "path_to_dashboards/dashboards/*.yml"
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  Make sure to update `path_to_charts/charts/*.yml` and
  `path_to_dashboards/dashboards/*.yml` to match the actual paths where your
  content as code files are stored (e.g., `lightdash/charts/*.yml` and
  `lightdash/dashboards/*.yml`).
</Note>
