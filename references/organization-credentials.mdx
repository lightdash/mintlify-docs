</Warning>

Organization credentials provide a secure and convenient way to manage warehouse connections across your Lightdash organization. Instead of requiring each user to input sensitive warehouse credentials when creating a project, organization admins can set up shared credentials that any organization member can use when creating new projects.

## What are organization credentials?

Organization credentials are warehouse connection credentials created and managed at the organization level. They allow you to:

- **Centralize credential management**: Admins maintain warehouse credentials in one place
- **Improve security**: Non-admin users can create projects without accessing sensitive credentials
- **Simplify project creation**: Users can select from pre-configured credentials instead of manually entering connection details
- **Enable self-service**: Team members can create projects independently without needing admin assistance

<Info>
  Organization credentials are compatible with preview projects, allowing the same secure credential workflow for both production and preview environments.

## Who can use organization credentials?

### Creating organization credentials

<Info>
  Only **organization admins** can create, edit, or delete organization credentials.
</Info>

Organization admins have exclusive control over managing organization credentials to ensure security and governance standards are maintained.

### Using organization credentials

**Organization developers or project admins** can use organization credentials when creating or updating new projects. When creating a project, users can select from available organization credentials without seeing the underlying sensitive connection details such as passwords or access keys. You can also configure the custom roles to limit the access to the project creation feature.

## Setting up organization credentials

  You must be an organization admin to set up organization credentials.
</Info>
