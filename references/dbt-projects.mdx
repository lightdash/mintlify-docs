You can easily make changes in dbt and see them updated in your Lightdash project.

<Info>
  Lightdash supports dbt v1.4.0 and above. If you are using an older version of dbt, you will need to upgrade to sync your project to Lightdash

## 1. Automatically: deploy your changes to Lightdash using a GitHub action[​](#1-automatically-deploy-your-changes-to-lightdash-using-a-github-action "Direct link to 1. Automatically: deploy your changes to Lightdash using a GitHub action")

If you've connected Lightdash to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Lightdash to deploy your project automatically. This is the easiest way to keep Lightdash in sync with your changes in dbt.

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets[​](#step-1-add-the-credentials-to-github-secrets "Direct link to Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets")

We are going to add some secrets and config to GitHub actions, but you don't want those to be public, so the best way to do this is to add them as secrets on Github.

<Info>
  If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action.
</Info>

Go to your repo, click on `Settings` , on the left sidebar, click on `Secrets` under `Security`. Now click on the `New repository secret`

![](/assets/images/github-secrets-fc35152c7ebb768974b385a0e2601dc5.jpg)

We need to add the following secrets:

#### `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`[​](#lightdash_api_key "Direct link to lightdash_api_key")

Create a new personal access token, by going to `Settings` > `Personal Access Tokens`. This is the token you'll put in for `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`.

![](/assets/images/personal-access-token-9ed8a8c2b16edc5ee745c4909d4093d3.png)

#### `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`[​](#lightdash_project "Direct link to lightdash_project")

The UUID for your project. For example, if your URL looks like `https://eu1.lightdash.cloud/projects/3538ab33-dc90-aabb-bc00-e50bba3a5f69/tables`, then `3538ab33-dc90-45f0-aabb-e50bba3a5f69` is your `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`

#### `LIGHTDASH_URL`[​](#lightdash_url "Direct link to lightdash_url")

This is either `https://eu1.lightdash.cloud` or `https://app.lightdash.cloud` for Lightdash Cloud users (check the URL to your Lightdash project). If you self-host, this should be your own custom domain.

#### `DBT_PROFILES`[​](#dbt_profiles "Direct link to dbt_profiles")

Some tips for this bit:

* You might be able to copy a bunch of the information from your local `profiles.yml` file. You can see what's in there by typing `cat ~/.dbt/profiles.yml` in your terminal.
* If you have a separate `prod` and `dev` profile, you probably want to use the information from your `prod` profile for your GitHub action.
* If you want to have different connection settings depending on the user that opened the pull request (dev profiles), then [check out this guide](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview#how-to-use-the-developer-credentials-in-your-preview-project).

Find your data warehouse from the list below to get a profiles.yml file template. Fill out this template, and this is your `DBT_PROFILES` secret.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="BigQuery">
    BigQuery OAuth:

    Step 1: create a secret called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

    Add the service account credentials (the JSON file) that you want to use for your GitHub action. It should look something like this:

    ```
    {  "type": "service_account",  "project_id": "jaffle_shop",  "private_key_id": "12345",  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- ... -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",  "client_email": "jaffle_shop@jaffle_shop.iam.gserviceaccount.com",  "client_id": "12345",  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/jaffle_shop"}
    ```

    Step 2: create another secret called `DBT_PROFILES`

    Copy-paste this template into the secret and fill out the details.

    This will always use this project connection in your GitHub actions. If you want your preview projects to have different connection settings depending on the user that opened the pull request (dev profiles), then see what you need to add to your secret [in this guide](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview#how-to-use-the-developer-credentials-in-your-preview-project).

    ```
    [my-bigquery-db]: # this is the name of your project  target: dev  outputs:    dev:      type: bigquery      method: oauth      keyfile: keyfile.json # no need to change this! We'll automatically use the keyfile you created in the last step.      project: [GCP project id]      dataset: [the name of your dbt dataset]

### Step 2: Create deploy.yml workflow in Github[​](#step-2-create-deployyml-workflow-in-github "Direct link to Step 2: Create deploy.yml workflow in Github")

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu.

If you don't have any GitHub actions, you'll just need to click on `Configure`

![Github actions page](/assets/images/github-actions-f74f88aa1b1413a111be7dbf16d65d53.png)

If you have some GitHub actions in your repo already, click on `New workflow`, then select `setup a workflow yourself`.

![](/assets/images/new-workflow-existing-actions-e321bd117d93bf139a01424d3771d0e6.jpg)

Now copy [this file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/deploy.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions) repo.

Give it a nice name like `deploy-lightdash.yml`

And commit this to your repo by clicking on `Start commit`.

### You're done\![​](#youre-done "Direct link to You're done!")

Everytime you make a change to your repo, on the `main` branch, it will automatically deploy your new config into your Lightdash projects

You can see the log on the `Github actions` page

![](/assets/images/github-run-e24152442d7002253f6fd6dc66a9a24e.png)

## 2. In the UI: Syncing your dbt changes using `refresh dbt`[​](#2-in-the-ui-syncing-your-dbt-changes-using-refresh-dbt "Direct link to 2-in-the-ui-syncing-your-dbt-changes-using-refresh-dbt")

Whenever you make changes to your YAML files, you can sync Lightdash and see these changes by clicking the `refresh dbt` button in the Explore view of the app.

![screenshot-refresh-dbt](/assets/images/screenshot-refresh-dbt-3b6ee58ee347b0b10cd89aacf09e3abf.png)

If you're using a git connection (like GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket), you'll need to push + merge your changes to the branch that your Lightdash project is connected to before you run `refresh dbt`.

## 3. From the command line: Syncing your dbt changes using `lightdash deploy`[​](#3-from-the-command-line-syncing-your-dbt-changes-using-lightdash-deploy "Direct link to 3-from-the-command-line-syncing-your-dbt-changes-using-lightdash-deploy")

If you're using the [Lightdash CLI](/guides/cli/how-to-install-the-lightdash-cli), you can use the `lightdash deploy` command to deploy your changes to your Lightdash project.

To read more about how to use `lightdash deploy`, [check out our docs](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-deploy).

## Note: If you've made any changes to the underlying data, you need to run dbt first[​](#note-if-youve-made-any-changes-to-the-underlying-data-you-need-to-run-dbt-first "Direct link to Note: If you've made any changes to the underlying data, you need to run dbt first")

If you've made any changes to the underlying data (for example, adding a new column in your `model.sql` file or changing the SQL logic of an existing dimension), then you need to run: `dbt run -m yourmodel` before you click `refresh dbt` in Lightdash.
