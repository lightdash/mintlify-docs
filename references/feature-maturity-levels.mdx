### Experimental

Experimental features are where we explore new ideas and test out proof of concepts.

- We're still building out core functionality, so things may be incomplete or unstable
- We might make breaking changes without much notice as we iterate
- We limit access to our internal team and design partners
- Our design partners help us figure out what the feature should do and how it should work
- We're in full feedback-driven development mode

### Early Access

Early Access features are stable and work well, but we're still actively testing and improving them based on your feedback.

- Work smoothly with good performance
- We might still make some changes based on what you tell us
- We provide comprehensive documentation
- Breaking changes are rare, and we'll always give you plenty of notice
- Our support team is ready to help
- We might put some usage limits in place while we fine-tune things
- We're getting these features ready for our full GA release

### Generally Available (GA)

GA features are production-ready and fully supported by our team.

- We provide complete documentation and training materials
- These features are stable with our commitment to backward compatibility

## Using Feature Maturity Levels

These levels help you understand what to expect from each feature's stability and performance, so you can decide what works best for your production environment and risk tolerance.

When you're evaluating features for your use case, we recommend considering the maturity level alongside your requirements for stability, support, and backward compatibility.
