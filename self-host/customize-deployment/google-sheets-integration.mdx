### Enable Google SSO

To authenticate Google users, first you need to enable [Google SSO](https://docs.lightdash.com/self-host/customize-deployment/use-sso-login-for-self-hosted-lightdash#google) on your server.

If you still want to keep users to login via email/password or another SSO provider, set `AUTH_GOOGLE_ENABLED=false`. This hides Google as a login option while still allowing the Google Sheets integration to work.

<Note>
  Lightdash requests the necessary OAuth scopes -`drive.file` and `spreadsheets` when users connect to Google Sheets.

### Create an API key for Google file picker

We use Google Drive picker API to allow you to select your spreadsheet files on `Syncs`

To create a Google Drive picker API you need to add a new API key in [APIs and services in Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Your Google project must have the following API's enabled:

- Google Picker API

Save the API key in a new environment variable `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY`
