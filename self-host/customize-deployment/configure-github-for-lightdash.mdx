### **Generate Certificate and Secret**

After creating your Github account you will need to generate a Client Secret.

Copy it and keep it safe, this will get used for the `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.

And a Private Key.

Convert the contents of the private key file into `base64` , this will get used for the `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

<Info>
  You should save both the Client Secret and the Private Key in a safe place as you might need them at a later time.
