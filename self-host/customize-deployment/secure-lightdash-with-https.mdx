To run Lightdash in production it is highly recommended to secure it with HTTPS. This is usually done using your cloud provider's load balancer or ingress controller. Optionally you could use a proxy service like \[nginx] ([https://www.nginx.com/](https://www.nginx.com/)) or [traefik](https://traefik.io/).

## Configuration options for HTTPS[â€‹](#configuration-options-for-https "Direct link to Configuration options for HTTPS")
