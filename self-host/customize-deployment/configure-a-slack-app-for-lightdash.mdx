In this guide we will show you how you can enable [the Slack integration](/references/slack-integration) on your on self-hosted Lightdash server.

### Create a new Slack APP on your organization

First we will have to create a Slack APP [https://api.slack.com/apps?new\_app=1](https://api.slack.com/apps?new%5Fapp=1)

You can select `From an app manifest` to make it easier.

Then select the workspace you want to enable this into. Later you can `enable distribution` if you want to use a different Slack workspace.

Then copy this manifest to allow URL unfurls in your app. **Make sure you update `your Lightdash URL` in the manifest below** (for example, `app.lightdash.cloud` or `eu1.lightdash.cloud`).

```json
display_information:
  name: Lightdash
  description: Share Lightdash URLs on your Slack
  background_color: '#7262ff'
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: Lightdash
    always_online: false
  unfurl_domains:
    - your-lightdash-deployment-url.com
oauth_config:
  redirect_urls:
    - https://your-lightdash-deployment-url.com/api/v1/slack/oauth_redirect
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - channels:join
      - channels:read
      - chat:write
      - chat:write.customize
      - files:read
      - files:write
      - groups:read
      - links:read
      - links:write
      - users:read
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    request_url: https://your-lightdash-deployment-url.com/slack/events
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - link_shared
  interactivity:
    is_enabled: true
    request_url: https://your-lightdash-deployment-url.com/slack/events
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

Finally, click on `create`

### Copying credentials

Now copy the following credentials from your new app.

From `Basic Information`

* Client ID
* Client secret (show and copy)
* Signing secret (show and copy)

### Adding credentials to your local environment

Now you need to add the following environment variables to your Lightdash server using the credentials we previously copied

* `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID (make sure it is between quotes, so it is a string, not a number)
* `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret
* `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Signing secret
* `SLACK_STATE_SECRET`: This can be any string

Restart your Lightdash service, now you should be able to use [the Slack integration](/references/slack-integration) on your self-hosted Lightdash.
