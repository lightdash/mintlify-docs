In this guide we will show you how you can enable [the Slack integration](/references/slack-integration) on your on self-hosted Lightdash server.

### Create a new Slack APP on your organization[​](#create-a-new-slack-app-on-your-organization "Direct link to Create a new Slack APP on your organization")

First we will have to create a Slack APP [https://api.slack.com/apps?new\_app=1](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)

You can select `From an app manifest` to make it easier.

Then select the workspace you want to enable this into. Later you can `enable distribution` if you want to use a different Slack workspace.

Then copy this manifest to allow URL unfurls in your app. **Make sure you update `your Lightdash URL` in the manifest below** (for example, `app.lightdash.cloud` or `eu1.lightdash.cloud`).

```
display_information:  name: Lightdash  description: Share Lightdash URLs on your Slack  background_color: '#7262ff'features:  bot_user:    display_name: Lightdash    always_online: false  unfurl_domains:    - your-lightdash-deployment-url.comoauth_config:  redirect_urls:    - https://your-lightdash-deployment-url.com/api/v1/slack/oauth_redirect  scopes:    bot:      - app_mentions:read      - channels:join      - channels:read      - chat:write      - chat:write.customize      - files:read      - files:write      - groups:read      - links:read      - links:write      - users:readsettings:  event_subscriptions:    request_url: https://your-lightdash-deployment-url.com/slack/events    bot_events:      - app_mention      - link_shared  interactivity:    is_enabled: true    request_url: https://your-lightdash-deployment-url.com/slack/events  org_deploy_enabled: false  socket_mode_enabled: false  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

Finally, click on `create`

### Copying credentials[​](#copying-credentials "Direct link to Copying credentials")

Now copy the following credentials from your new app.

From `Basic Information`

* Client ID
* Client secret (show and copy)
* Signing secret (show and copy)

### Adding credentials to your local environment[​](#adding-credentials-to-your-local-environment "Direct link to Adding credentials to your local environment")

Now you need to add the following environment variables to your Lightdash server using the credentials we previously copied

* `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID (make sure it is between quotes, so it is a string, not a number)
* `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret
* `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Signing secret
* `SLACK_STATE_SECRET`: This can be any string

Restart your Lightdash service, now you should be able to use [the Slack integration](/references/slack-integration) on your self-hosted Lightdash.
