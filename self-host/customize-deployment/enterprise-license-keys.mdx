Enterprise License Keys enable access to advanced Lightdash Enterprise Edition features on self-hosted instances. These features include enhanced security, performance optimizations, and advanced collaboration tools designed for large organizations.

## Getting an Enterprise License Key

To obtain an Enterprise License Key for your self-hosted Lightdash instance:

1. **Contact our team** - [Schedule a call with our enterprise team](https://calendly.com/lightdash-cloud/enterprise?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise_licensing&utm_content=license_key_page) to discuss your requirements and get your license key.

2. **Receive your license key** - Our team will provide you with a unique license key tailored to your organization's needs.

## Configuring Your License Key

Once you have received your Enterprise License Key, you need to configure it in your Lightdash deployment.

### Using Environment Variables

Add the following environment variable to your Lightdash configuration:

```bash
LIGHTDASH_LICENSE_KEY=your-enterprise-license-key-here
```

### Using Helm (Kubernetes)

If you're deploying Lightdash on Kubernetes using Helm, add the license key to your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
secrets:
  LIGHTDASH_LICENSE_KEY: your-enterprise-license-key-here
```

Then update your Helm deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade lightdash lightdash/lightdash -n lightdash -f values.yaml
```

### Using Docker Compose

For Docker Compose deployments, add the license key to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  lightdash:
    environment:
      - LIGHTDASH_LICENSE_KEY=your-enterprise-license-key-here
```

## Verifying Your License

After configuring your license key and restarting Lightdash, you can verify that enterprise features are enabled by:

1. Logging in as an admin user
2. Navigating to Settings â†’ Organization
3. Checking for the "Enterprise Edition" badge
