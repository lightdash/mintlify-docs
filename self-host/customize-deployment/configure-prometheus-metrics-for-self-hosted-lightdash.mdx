Lightdash can expose Prometheus metrics to help you monitor the performance and health of your Lightdash instance. This guide explains how to enable and configure Prometheus metrics for your self-hosted Lightdash deployment.

## Enabling Prometheus metrics

By default, Prometheus metrics are disabled in Lightdash. To enable them, set the following environment variable:

```bash
LIGHTDASH_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
```

## Configuration options

You can customize the Prometheus metrics endpoint using the following environment variables:

| Variable                                    | Description                                                                     | Required? |           Default           |
|:--------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------:|:---------------------------:|
| `LIGHTDASH_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED`              | Enables/Disables Prometheus metrics endpoint                                    |           |           `false`           |
| `LIGHTDASH_PROMETHEUS_PORT`                 | Port for Prometheus metrics endpoint                                            |           |           `9090`            |
| `LIGHTDASH_PROMETHEUS_PATH`                 | Path for Prometheus metrics endpoint                                            |           |         `/metrics`          |
| `LIGHTDASH_PROMETHEUS_PREFIX`               | Prefix for metric names                                                         |           |                             |
| `LIGHTDASH_GC_DURATION_BUCKETS`             | Buckets for duration histogram in seconds                                       |           | `0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 5` |
| `LIGHTDASH_EVENT_LOOP_MONITORING_PRECISION` | Precision for event loop monitoring in milliseconds. Must be greater than zero. |           |            `10`             |
| `LIGHTDASH_PROMETHEUS_LABELS`               | Labels to add to all metrics. Must be valid JSON                                |           |                             |

## Configuring Prometheus to scrape Lightdash metrics

Once you've enabled the Prometheus metrics endpoint in Lightdash, you need to configure your Prometheus server to scrape these metrics. Add the following job to your Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'lightdash'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-lightdash-host:9090']
```

Replace `your-lightdash-host` with the hostname or IP address of your Lightdash instance, and adjust the port
if you've changed the default.

## Available metrics

## Using metrics for monitoring and alerting

You can use these metrics to create dashboards and alerts in your monitoring system. Some common use cases include:

- Monitoring memory usage and setting alerts for potential memory leaks
- Tracking PostgreSQL connection pool utilization
- Monitoring event loop lag to detect performance issues
- Setting up alerts for high CPU usage

For example, you might want to create alerts for:

- High memory usage: `process_resident_memory_bytes > threshold`
- Event loop lag: `nodejs_eventloop_lag_p99_seconds > threshold`
- Database connection pool saturation: `pg_active_connections / pg_pool_max_size > 0.8`
