2. Select the _Credentials_ tab.
3. Click _Add credential_.![add-credentials](/images/self-host/restack-add-credentials-169204966d7f6e01aa644c1d96b950c4.png)

### One-click cluster creation with Restack[](#one-click-cluster-creation-with-restack "Direct link to One-click cluster creation with Restack")


<Info>
Why do I need a cluster?
Running your application on a Kubernetes cluster lets you deploy, scale and monitor the application reliably.
</Info>
Once you have added your credentials,

1. Navigate to the _Clusters_ tab on the same page and click on _Create cluster_.![create-cluster](/images/self-host/restack-create-cluster-1e9c62264d5201a393d39e577fd9d8e4.png)
2. Give a suitable name to your cluster.
3. Select the region you want to deploy the cluster in.
4. Select the AWS credentials you added in the previous step.![cluster-details](/images/self-host/restack-cluster-details-d5c9900aebf5122b3907e650751cbd10.png)

The cluster creation process will start automatically. Once the cluster is ready, you will get an email on the email id connected with your account.
Creating a cluster is a one-time process. From here you can add other open source tools or multiple instances of Lightdash in the same cluster.

### Deploy multiple instances of Lightdash[](#deploy-multiple-instances-of-lightdash "Direct link to Deploy multiple instances of Lightdash")

Restack makes it easier to deploy multiple instances of Lightdash on the same or multiple clusters.
So you can test the latest version before upgrading or have a dedicated instance for development and for production.
