### One-click cluster creation with Restack

<Info>
**Why do I need a cluster?**
  
Running your application on a Kubernetes cluster lets you deploy, scale and monitor the application reliably.
</Info>

Once you have added your credentials,

1. Navigate to the _Clusters_ tab on the same page and click on _Create cluster_.![create-cluster](/images/self-host/restack-create-cluster-1e9c62264d5201a393d39e577fd9d8e4.png)
2. Give a suitable name to your cluster.
3. Select the region you want to deploy the cluster in.
4. Select the AWS credentials you added in the previous step.![cluster-details](/images/self-host/restack-cluster-details-d5c9900aebf5122b3907e650751cbd10.png)

The cluster creation process will start automatically. Once the cluster is ready, you will get an email on the email id connected with your account.
Creating a cluster is a one-time process. From here you can add other open source tools or multiple instances of Lightdash in the same cluster.

### Deploy multiple instances of Lightdash

So you can test the latest version before upgrading or have a dedicated instance for development and for production.
