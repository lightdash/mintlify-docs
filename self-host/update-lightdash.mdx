## Local deployments[​](#local-deployments "Direct link to Local deployments")

If you're running Lightdash on your own laptop using Docker, you just need to instruct Docker to pull the latest version of Lightdash:

```
docker pull lightdash/lightdash
```

Now restart Lightdash and you'll be upgraded to the latest version.

## Kubernetes/helm deployments[​](#kuberneteshelm-deployments "Direct link to Kubernetes/helm deployments")

If you install Lightdash into kubernetes using our [community helm charts](https://github.com/lightdash/helm-charts) you need to update your helm chart repository and upgrade your deployment.

```
helm repo update lightdashhelm upgrade -f values.yml lightdash lightdash/lightdash
```
