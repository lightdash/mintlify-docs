In Lightdash there are three primary ways to share insights with your team:

* Share a URL to a 'work-in-progress' data exploration
* Share a link to a saved chart
* Download results as a .csv or a .png of the chart


### Share a draft URL

As you explore your data in Lightdash, the URL contains a unique link to your work in progress.

Copy and paste the URL while you're exploring data and anybody with access to your Lightdash project can jump into the Explore view at exactly the same point you're at. Sometimes, the link can get very long if you have a lot of information in your chart, so you can use the built-in link shortener to grab a short link:

### Share a saved chart

##### Save your chart

You can create a new saved chart or update an existing saved chart by clicking the 'Save chart' button on the chart panel. You'll have an option to [save to a Space or a Dashboard](/get-started/exploring-data/using-explores#save-your-chart).

##### Share your chart

Everyone in your project has access to the saved charts (as long as they have access to the Space where you saved it). All they need to do is click on **Browse->All saved charts**. You can also send them the URL directly.

### Download results or chart image

You can download your chart as JPEG, PNG, SVG, PDF, or JSON with Opaque or Transparent background. You can also choose to download the file or copy to clipboard by clicking the export icon on the chart.

You can also download your results table as a CSV, Excel spreadsheet, or export them to a Google Sheet (if your organization has that set up).
