Dashboards allow you to arrange multiple charts that are related to each other into a single view.

The process for creating dashboards is as follows: 

1. [Create a new dashboard](/get-started/exploring-data/dashboards#create-a-new-dashboard)
2. [Add charts to your dashboard](/get-started/exploring-data/dashboards#add-a-chart-to-your-dashboard)
3. [Add markdown or other content](/get-started/exploring-data/dashboards#add-markdown-or-other-content)
4. [Save your dashboard](/get-started/exploring-data/dashboards#save-your-dashboard)
5. [Add filters to your dashboards](/get-started/exploring-data/dashboards#add-filters)
6. [Add tabs to your dashboard](/get-started/exploring-data/dashboards#add-tabs)
7. [Share your dashboard](/get-started/exploring-data/dashboards#share-your-dashboard)


## Create a new dashboard

On the nav bar, click "New" to create a new dashboard.

    alt=""
  />
</Frame>

Fill out the details of your new dashboard and hit 'Create'. Once done, you will be redirected to your new Dashboard page:

    alt=""
  />
</Frame>

Next, you'll want to add some tiles to your dashboard by clicking on the `add tile` button.


## Add a chart to your dashboard

You can either create a new chart from within your dashboard, or you can add an existing chart.


### Create a new chart

Creating charts from within a dashboard helps to keep your spaces and projects clutter-free from charts that are used only once in a dashboard.

Charts that are created from within your dashboard are exclusive to the dashboard. This means that they can't be reused in other dashboards in your project.

Click "Add tile" and then "New chart" to create a chart that is exclusive to the dashboard. You will be taken to the chart builder. Once you save the chart it will appear at the bottom of your dashboard.

    alt=""
  />
</Frame>

Note: These charts can't be used in other dashboards and won't be shown in the global search or in any space. If you want to make these charts reusable in other dashboards, you can detatch them from the dashboard and save them to a space so they're permanent using the `move to space` option from the chart's three-dot-menu.

  />
</Frame>


### Add an existing chart

You can add an existing chart to your dashboard by clicking "Add tile" and then "Saved chart". Clicking any chart will add it at the bottom of your dashboard.

<Frame>

    alt=""
  />
</Frame>

You can resize charts by dragging the lower-right corner.

You can position your chart by dragging the center of the chart.


## Add markdown or other content

In addition to charts, you can also add markdown tiles or embedded Loom videos to explain the dashboard to people who will be using it.


### Markdown tiles

These tiles are very flexible and allow you to enter text with headers, formatting, etc. You can even include code blocks and images within markdown tiles. The built-in editor provides most formatting you'll need.

<Tip>You can even paste IFRAME embed codes in these tiles so you can embed things like Notion pages, views into other systems like web analytics, etc. Anything that offers IFRAME embedding!</Tip>

One option that isn't available in the editor is text centering. That can be achieved like this:

```markdown
<h2 style="text-align:center">This is my centered title</h2>
```

<Accordion title="Other HTML markdown tile options">
  
There are a number of other inline HTML options available. Below are some examples - Copy and paste them into a markdown tile to check them out!

```markdown
Check out this <b>bold</b> word.
You can also do <i>italics</i>.
And even <u>underline</u>.
Or maybe you want to <s>strikethrough</s>.

Show code snippets like <code>Hello World!</code>.
Or <mark>highlight</mark> something important.

Add links like <a href="https://docs.lightdash.com/">this!</a>

Use <sub>subscript</sub> or <sup>superscript</sup>

<p style="color:red">Easily colour your text.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Or change the size.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Center your text.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Or align it to the right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">You can even justify a line of text if you are trying to communicate a point that is particularly long, perhaps something like this example sentence?</p>
<p style="word-spacing:5px">Change the word spacing. üëè</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:blue">
    Or combine a whole bunch of styles together.
</p>

<h1>We also support headings</h1>
<h2 style="color:red">Here's an H2 heading in red</h2>

You can also include images and apply different alt options and styles. Here's one I centered earlier:

<img src="https://placehold.co/300x200" alt="Centered Image" style="display:block;margin:0 auto" />
```

</Accordion>


### Loom tiles

All you need to do for embedding Loom videos is click on the Loom video option and enter a URL and title for the tile.


## Save your dashboard

When you're happy with the layout, hit "Save".

You can also see all of the saved dashboards in your project by clicking on `Browse` --> `All Dashboards`.

<Frame>

    alt=""
  />
</Frame>


## Add filters

Filters let you narrow down the data displayed across your dashboard charts. You can add filters while editing your dashboard or apply temporary filters while viewing.

To add a saved filter that all viewers will see:

1. Click `Edit dashboard`
2. Click `Add filter`
3. Select a field and optionally set a default value
4. Click `Apply`, then `Save`

  />
</Frame>

For detailed information on filter types, temporary vs saved filters, required filters, and advanced filtering options, see the [using filters guide](/guides/limiting-data-using-filters).


## Add tabs

As your dashboard grows you may find it supporting multiple teams and use cases. Lets add tabs to your dashboard for better organization!

<Tip>
  ### Use tabs in these scenarios

  - **Break up high level goals or themes**, e.g. Revenue, Retention, Engagement
  - **Separate views for different audiences**, e.g. Executive Summary vs. Team-level detail
  - **Avoid clutter and performance issues in dashboards with lots of tiles**, e.g. split 30+ charts into three tabs based on priority or groupings like the first and second bullets above
</Tip>

While editing, click "Add tile" and then "Add tab".

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/get-started/exploring-data/tabs-new.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

Give your new tab a unique name.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/get-started/exploring-data/tabs-name.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

Once created, you can add content to your tab just like any other dashboard. You now have a new canvas to add content to your dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/get-started/exploring-data/tabs-added.png" alt="" />
</Frame>


### Editing and removing tabs

To edit a tab, click on the edit icon to the right of your tab name while in dashboard edit mode. You can either rename or remove the tab from your dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/get-started/exploring-data/tabs-edit.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

If you have content in a tab, you'll have an option to safely remove that tab. This gives you an opportunity to transfer tab content to another tab.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/get-started/exploring-data/tabs-remove.png" alt="" />
</Frame>

From there, choose which tab you'd like to transfer the content. This way, you can keep your content while removing the actual tab.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/get-started/exploring-data/tabs-transfer-content.png" alt="" />
</Frame>


### Sharing tabs

You can share tab content just like you would a regular dashboard. Sharable links will navigate right to the tab that was active when you created the shareable link.

### Embedding dashboard tabs

Embeddings with tabs work slightly differently. When embedding a dashboard with tabs, all the tabs will be appended to the dashboard. In this case, the embeddeding will be one dashboard with all content from all tabs.


## Share your dashboard

You might want to share your dashboard with other people in your organization. You can do this by copying the URL (or by pressing on the üîó button).
