## Login

The CLI uses browser-based OAuth login by default, making authentication quick and easy.

### Basic login



```bash
lightdash login {{ lightdash_domain }}
```

where `{{ lightdash_domain }}` is the subdomain for your Lightdash instance. For example, if you login at `https://petey.lightdash.cloud`, then you would type `lightdash login petey` to pop up a login window.


```bash
lightdash login petey
```

This opens your browser to authenticate. Once authorized, you're logged in and ready to use the CLI.

### Flexible URL formats

The CLI accepts your instance URL in multiple formats, all of these work:

```bash
# Just your subdomain (recommended for Lightdash Cloud)
lightdash login your_subdomain_here

# Full domain without protocol
lightdash login your_subdomain_here.lightdash.cloud

# Full URL with protocol
lightdash login https://your_subdomain_here.lightdash.cloud

# Any URL from your Lightdash instance (useful for copying from browser)
lightdash login https://your_subdomain_here.lightdash.cloud/projects/abc123/dashboards
```

For Lightdash Cloud users, you can simply use your subdomain (e.g., `petey` if your instance is at `petey.lightdash.cloud`).

For self-hosted instances, you can use the full domain without the `https://` prefix - it's assumed automatically.


### Re-authenticate to a previous instance

Once you've logged in, you can re-authenticate without specifying the URL:

```bash
lightdash login
```

This uses your previously saved instance URL.

  <Accordion title="Login with email and password">
    If you prefer to use email and password instead of browser-based OAuth:

    ```bash
    lightdash login your_subdomain_here --no-oauth
    ```

    You'll be prompted to enter your email and password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Login with a personal access token (for SSO users)">
    If you use single sign-on (SSO) in the browser, login with a personal access token.

    First, create a new personal access token in the UI by going to Settings > Personal Access Tokens.

    </Frame>

    Then, run the following command:

    ```bash
    lightdash login your_subdomain_here --token
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Login with environment variables (for CI/CD)">
    You can use the following environment variables to authenticate yourself on each command:

    * **LIGHTDASH\_API\_KEY** a personal access token you can generate in the app under the user settings

    * **LIGHTDASH\_URL** address for your running Lightdash instance

    * **LIGHTDASH\_PROXY\_AUTHORIZATION** if your Lightdash instance is behind a proxy like [Cloud IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap) you can set here `Proxy-Authentication` header value

    Example:

    ```bash
    LIGHTDASH_API_KEY=946fedb74003405646867dcacf1ad345 LIGHTDASH_URL="https://your_subdomain_here.lightdash.cloud" LIGHTDASH_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" lightdash preview
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Set active project

When you login you'll be asked to set an active project.

Your active project is just the one that you're working on/developing in. Your organization might just have one project, so that makes your decision easy!

You can change your active project by running:

```bash
lightdash config set-project
```

Or you can use the `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT` environment variable to indicate what project UUID the command should use.

Example:

```bash
LIGHTDASH_PROJECT="3675b69e-8324-4110-bdca-059031aa8da3" lightdash deploy
```

## Now that you've logged in, you're ready to use the CLI

You can see all of the actions available on the CLI by typing this in your terminal:

```bash
lightdash
```
