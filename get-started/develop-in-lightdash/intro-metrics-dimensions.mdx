* An intro to metrics and dimensions

## What are metrics and dimensions?[â€‹](#what-are-metrics-and-dimensions "Direct link to What are metrics and dimensions?")

Metrics and dimensions are defined in your dbt project alongside your dbt model properties.

* **Dimensions** are used to **segment data** in your Tables.
* **Metrics** are used to **perform calculations** on your Tables.

Say we're running an ecommerce business, we probably have a table containing all order data. We might want to ask:

This question can be answered using a single metric "the total number of unique orders" and a single dimension for splitting the metric by "status of order". In Lightdash you'd get the following chart:
